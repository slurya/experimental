customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business.

The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSource__c', 'content': 'FilePath__c'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSourceObject__c', 'content': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm'}, {'objectName': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'fieldName': 'FilePath__c', 'content': 'data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf'}]}, {'metadata': [{'source_object_record_id': 'combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf', 'source_object_api_name': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'link': 'https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=cf42c28fde5b5ae0360752525ba7c026530b5cb9fbba4c6b069967f76415d957'}], 'id': None, 'contents': [{'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'Chunk__c', 'content': 'Want to learn more?

In this badge you learn about connecting B2B Commerce for Visualforce because there are more use cases to consider. (There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations. For every use case covered in this badge you learn considerations and guardrails to ensure your project is a success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Get to Know Salesforce Customers-Centric Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalesforce seeks to be customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlearn from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nWhen Sales Cloud, B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud are connected, everyone in the B2B sales process benefits. Buyers get a consistent experience from cart to payment, even when a sales rep generates a personalized quote for them. Price managers get a single system for managing products and prices. The back office gets centralized billing integration with their ERP, as well as easy-to-maintain service agreements. With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nSalesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce each have their own specialized product types and pricing methods designed to support more complex business needs. For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product. You can also synchronize other product types by extending the connector.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCPQ Product / Pricing B2B Commerce Product / Pricing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDiscount Schedules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTiered Pricing Products\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBundles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKits / Bundles / Dynamic Kits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPercent of Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct with Service Layer customization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubscription\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct with Subscription Product Term\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you can sync bundles with the connector, avoid CPQ bundles that use many options, constraints, or product rules. You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe product.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nWhen a sale reaches the ordered phase, typically the order is activated at some point. This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nPlan your Data Sync Strategy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn important part of your overall solution design is your approach to synching primary data. Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Want to learn more?

Salesforce will continue to support the Visualforce deployment option. Customers do not need to move, and Salesforce will continue to support and innovate on Visualforce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, once you get to know the Lightning Experience options, you can design a thoughtful transition from the existing user interface that reevaluates existing customizations and eliminates old problems. Then you\\\\u2019re armed with the data to make a compelling case to your leadership and other decision makers to implement this transition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s Sum It Up\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this unit, you learned what it means for B2B Commerce to be on the amazing Lightning Experience. You explored features and benefits, and how to transition to Lightning Experience on B2B Commerce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow take this last quiz and earn another badge!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrailhead: Personalized Email Marketing \\\\u2022 _Trailhead: _Lightning Experience Basics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Explore B2B Commerce on Lightning Experience \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 5 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: commerce-basics/explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Explore B2B Commerce on Lightning Experience \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 5 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: commerce-basics/explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_3.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Take the experience of a large consumer goods company based in the U.S. For years, the company ran a fully staffed call center to take orders from small accounts. When it added digital commerce, the team expected to streamline processes and cut costs. But as the company analyzed sales, it was pleasantly surprised to see that revenue per customer was increasing steadily, as well. In fact, customers liked ordering on their own and responded more readily to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nautomated cross-selling messaging than to the call center reps. That feedback gave the company confidence to invest in enhancements to its landing page and build more sophisticated cross-sell and upsell capabilities.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOK, so let\\\\u2019s assume you\\\\u2019ve now got a clear idea of the change you\\\\u2019d like to bring about that better serves the expectations and needs of your customers.

We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\n\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\n\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\n\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\n\\\\nlearn from.\\\\n\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\n\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=29b395a5ef9472b8199802403c3e5f9ceb74fa65ae4d0d15e0c588fa1c3e8a01\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Finally, this badge is meant to give you a high-level view of solutions involving multiple clouds.

With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\n\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\n\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=29b395a5ef9472b8199802403c3e5f9ceb74fa65ae4d0d15e0c588fa1c3e8a01\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Experience. In this badge you learn about connecting B2B Commerce for Visualforce because there are more use cases to consider. (There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\n\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\n\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\n\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations.

For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\n\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\n\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product.

You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\n\\\\nthe product.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_3.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_3.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=273ead32dd11591c569b01b1793e6fca2f8c0417879d205c64c8ad5e53cb6099\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Take the experience of a large consumer goods company based in the U.S. For years, the company ran a fully staffed call center to take orders from small accounts.

This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\n\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\n\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=cf42c28fde5b5ae0360752525ba7c026530b5cb9fbba4c6b069967f76415d957\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Want to learn more?

Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\n\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\n\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=dc9a7b7b1b26e209dc5713a7e6293d816870c39dc5cb951f61841193a248137f\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Salesforce data and processes, making it easier for storefront managers to launch ecommerce sites and make optimizations quickly. |\\\\n\\\\nWhat If I Have B2B Commerce on Classic (Visualforce) Today?\\\\n\\\\nSince 2015, when Salesforce first launched Lightning Experience, many new cus- tomers started using it right away and many existing customers have transitioned to it from Classic (or Visualforce).\\\\n\\\\nBut some current B2B Customers wonder whether they must move from Visual- force to Lightning Experience.\\\\n\\\\nThe short answer is no.

(There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\n\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\n\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\n\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations. For every use case covered in this badge you learn considerations and guardrails to ensure your project is a success.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Get to Know Salesforce Customers-Centric Discovery\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce seeks to be customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\n\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\n\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\n\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\n\\\\nlearn from.\\\\n\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\n\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\\n###\\\\nWhen Sales Cloud, B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud are connected, everyone in the B2B sales process benefits. Buyers get a consistent experience from cart to payment, even when a sales rep generates a personalized quote for them. Price managers get a single system for managing products and prices. The back office gets centralized billing integration with their ERP, as well as easy-to-maintain service agreements. With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\n\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\n\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\n###\\\\nSalesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce each have their own specialized product types and pricing methods designed to support more complex business needs. For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\n\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\n\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product. You can also synchronize other product types by extending the connector.\\\\n\\\\nCPQ Product / Pricing B2B Commerce Product / Pricing\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nDiscount Schedules\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nTiered Pricing Products\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nBundles\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nKits / Bundles / Dynamic Kits\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nPercent of Total\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nProduct with Service Layer customization\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nSubscription\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nProduct with Subscription Product Term\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhile you can sync bundles with the connector, avoid CPQ bundles that use many options, constraints, or product rules. You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\n\\\\nthe product.\\\\n###\\\\nWhen a sale reaches the ordered phase, typically the order is activated at some point. This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\n\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\n\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\n\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\n\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\\n###\\\\nPlan your Data Sync Strategy\\\\n\\\\nAn important part of your overall solution design is your approach to synching primary data. Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\n\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\n\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Want to learn more?

Click 2. In the Quick Find box, enter Manufacturing, select Manufacturing. 3. Under Feature Settings, click Advanced Account Forecasting , and navigate to the Forecast Sets tab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n, and select Setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Click New Forecast Set and provide the following details: \\\\u2022 Name: Industrial_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Industrial_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add another forecast set with the following details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Consumer_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Consumer_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 4: Note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you create a forecast set, it\\\\u2019s in an inactive state. After you define all the parameters, you can activate the set. To edit a forecast set, you must deactivate the set first, make changes, and then activate it again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrange Your Building Blocks\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy now defines the parameters for Field Mappings and Frequencies for both the forecast sets. She\\\\u2019s keeping a close eye on the sales team\\\\u2019s requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy starts with the industrial forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Click Edit on Industrial_Set record. 2. Expand the Building Blocks section. 3. Click Edit on the Field Mappings tab. 4. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nAccount: Account ID \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.

Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy repeats the configurations for the consumer forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Click Edit on Consumer_Set record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Expand the Building Blocks section. 3. Click Edit on the Field Mappings tab. 4. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccount: Channel Name \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Click Edit on the Frequencies tab. 7. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculation Frequency: Monthly \\\\u2022 Rollover Frequency: Quarterly\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy has taken care of yet another request from the sales team. Forecasts for both business units now will be calculated monthly and rolled over quarterly. Also, the accounts for the Consumer business unit are modeled by Channel, which she added as a forecasting metric. Forecast field mappings are the structural pillars of a forecast. The required fields to create a forecast are Account, Period, Status, Forecast Quantity, Forecast Revenue, and Forecast Set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, she selects Data Processing Engine definitions for forecast processes. Cindy has already cloned and customized the predefined Data Processing Engine templates that came with the feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe four Data Processing Engine templates serve specific purposes for forecast calculations. Cindy reviews them quickly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPurpose\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerate Account Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_37.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: After this, Jackie created the manufacturing program, created a Forecast Set Use record, and imported the forecast data using CSV files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the program in place, the engineering manager created relationships between Xela\\\\u2019s product variants and Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 components. And now we are here!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you remember, Susan has already cloned and customized the predefined DPE definitions to suit Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 requirements. And she\\\\u2019s associated these definitions in the Xela PowerUp Components Set forecast set. Since the program is ready, her next task is to run the Data Processing Engine that can generate component forecasts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDPE Templates and How They Work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManufacturing Cloud includes four DPE templates that you can use to calculate your forecasts. You can identify the DPEs by their Process Type, which is Program Based Business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: The four predefined Data Processing Engine definitions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s find out more about the definitions and how they work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData Processing Engine Template What Does It Do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you generate component forecasts for the first time for a program, use this definition. Susan can also trigger it when the underlying program and variant forecast have changed since the last run and Jackie imports new forecasts for a program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor each period, the forecast gets calculated to give you the latest values. For Rayler Motors, this definition runs each month. Susan can also trigger it when new components are introduced, or if there are new Product Related Material records that have been created since the last run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRollover Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the end of each month, the forecast display rolls over to expire the forecast for the first period, and add another period to the display. This definition generates component forecasts for new periods.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nRegenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you make changes to the forecast set configurations or change the dimen- sions and period groups, run this definition to generate forecasts based on the updated parameters. The definition expires the existing forecast records and creates new forecasts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe DPEs first extract data from the following object records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Period \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Period Group \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Set Use \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Component Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template Item \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Variant Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Period \\\\u2022 Price Book \\\\u2022 Price Book Entry \\\\u2022 Product \\\\u2022 Product Related Material\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The Data Source nodes in the Generate Program Component Forecast Data Processing Engine definition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach DPE then joins, filters, and aggregates data, applies other transformations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlike formulas and slices, and finally writes back the data to the Manufacturing Program Component Forecast object. The measure fields like Total Cost Per Unit, Expected Profit Per Unit, and Selling Price Per Unit are populated, along with the system-calculated Forecasted Quantity and Forecasted Revenue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo automate the process of getting forecasts updated every week, Susan runs these definitions through separate scheduled Salesforce Flow definitions. When there are new programs that require new component forecasts, or existing forecasts that need recalculating, the flow triggers these processes. Susan runs a flow that generates forecasts for the new Xela PowerUp program. When the flow run is successful, she informs Jackie.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: The manufacturing program record is active and Jackie sees that she can click Import CSV to start uploading the program forecasts that she has gathered from IHS Markit. But before she imports the CSVs, she must create Forecast Set Use records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The Details tab of the Xela PowerUp program record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCreate Forecast Set Use Records\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Susan defined the Forecast Set Field Mappings in a forecast set, she mapped the Forecast Set field with Advanced Account Forecast Set Use ID. What does that do? Think of the forecast set as the template that dictates how forecasts are configured and displayed. When you specify the accounts or manufacturing programs for which a particular set is used, that\\\\u2019s a Forecast Set Use record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackie must create two Forecast Set Use records, one for the program and another for variants because two different forecast set configurations are used to create the forecasts at these levels. She won\\\\u2019t need to create a Forecast Set Use record for components because when the Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts, a Forecast Set Use record is automatically created by the application.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the values Jackie uses to create a Forecast Set Use record for programs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Xela Program \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Program Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShe creates another Forecast Set Use record for variants with the following values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Xela Variant \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Variants Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackie can now import the CSV files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: The Advanced Account Forecast Fact Set Use record for a manufac- turing program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Rayler Parts, a manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy machinery, is having a successful run with Manufacturing Cloud. With advanced account forecasts, the sales and operations team can create flexible and granular forecasts. The business is growing rapidly and account managers are always looking at new requirements to refine their forecast calculations further. Data Processing Engine (DPE) already helps them transform their data and automate the complex calculations that create\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\naccount forecasts, but they want more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRayler Parts sells its products through two distinct business units: Industrial and Consumer. You saw in the Advanced Account Forecasting with Manufacturing Cloud module how these business units have different forecast requirements. Cindy fulfilled the requirements by creating two forecast sets for the two business units and specifying the unit-specific configurations in each set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this module, follow Cindy as she explores the Data Processing Engine tool and learns about its role in forecasting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQuick Refresher on Advanced Account Forecasting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy\\\\u2019s starting to think more about customizing forecasts and that requires customization of the DPE templates that are used for forecast calculations. But first, she explores the basic concepts of advanced account forecasting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow does the system determine what to display on a forecast grid? The Advanced Account Forecast Set holds the configurations that determine how your forecast looks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow does the system calculate the forecast values?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe DPE definitions hold the calculation logic to compute the forecast data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhere is the forecast data stored for each period?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Advanced Account Forecast Fact object holds the forecast data for each period in a separate record. Forecast measures and dimensions are available as fields on this object.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe columns in the forecast table are the forecast dimensions. These are the parameters by which you group and aggregate the data. So, if you want to view forecast data grouped by product category and location for each period, those are your forecast dimensions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: In a forecast table, forecast measures act as the rows and the forecast dimensions act as the columns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can imagine, setting up a forecast table can be difficult. So Manufacturing Cloud provides a predefined table called the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. Think of it like a recipe for forecasts where the measures and dimensions are readily available as fields. You can use the object as-is, add new fields to it, or remove fields you don\\\\u2019t need. Further, if you want to use a custom object, you can use the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object as a reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat Is the Data Processing Engine?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo now Cindy knows that the forecast data is housed in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. The dimensions and the metrics make up the fields. But how are the values for the metrics calculated? And, how do the values get populated in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact records? That\\\\u2019s where the Data Processing Engine comes in. First, she gets familiar with a few terms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE definition is a precise recipe used to transform your data. \\\\u2022 A DPE template i s a pre-made transformation recipe. Manufacturing Cloud provides DPE templates that you can clone to get started.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE node is an ingredient or step in the recipe. Nodes can define source objects or perform actions on the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE definition runs as a job in your org, primarily via flows, to calculate forecast metric values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_7.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Define a Forecast Set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow it\\\\u2019s time for Cindy to create the forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

A forecast set is made up of the following components. We address one component at a time and show the parameters that Cindy creates for each forecast set.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding Blocks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Forecast Periods and Fact Object \\\\u2013 Forecast Fact Field Mappings \\\\u2013 Forecast Frequencies \\\\u2013 Data Processing Engine Definitions\\\\n\\\\nForecast Dimensions \\\\u2022 Forecast Measures \\\\u2022 Forecast Adjustment Periods \\\\u2022 Forecast Formulas\\\\n\\\\nCindy first creates two Forecast Set records.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The list of components that make up a forecast set.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n1. Click 2. In the Quick Find box, enter Manufacturing, select Manufacturing. 3. Under Feature Settings, click Advanced Account Forecasting , and navigate to the Forecast Sets tab.\\\\n\\\\n, and select Setup.\\\\n\\\\n4. Click New Forecast Set and provide the following details: \\\\u2022 Name: Industrial_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Industrial_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\n\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add another forecast set with the following details.\\\\n\\\\nName: Consumer_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Consumer_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\n\\\\nFigure 4: Note\\\\n\\\\nWhen you create a forecast set, it\\\\u2019s in an inactive state. After you define all the parameters, you can activate the set. To edit a forecast set, you must deactivate the set first, make changes, and then activate it again.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nArrange Your Building Blocks\\\\n\\\\nCindy now defines the parameters for Field Mappings and Frequencies for both the forecast sets. She\\\\u2019s keeping a close eye on the sales team\\\\u2019s requirements.\\\\n\\\\nCindy starts with the industrial forecast set.\\\\n\\\\n1. Click Edit on Industrial_Set record. 2. Expand the Building Blocks section. 3. Click Edit on the Field Mappings tab. 4. Select the following:\\\\n###\\\\nAccount: Account ID \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\n\\\\n5.

Select the following:\\\\n\\\\nAccount: Channel Name \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\n\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Click Edit on the Frequencies tab. 7. Select the following:\\\\n\\\\nCalculation Frequency: Monthly \\\\u2022 Rollover Frequency: Quarterly\\\\n\\\\n8. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nCindy has taken care of yet another request from the sales team. Forecasts for both business units now will be calculated monthly and rolled over quarterly. Also, the accounts for the Consumer business unit are modeled by Channel, which she added as a forecasting metric. Forecast field mappings are the structural pillars of a forecast. The required fields to create a forecast are Account, Period, Status, Forecast Quantity, Forecast Revenue, and Forecast Set.\\\\n\\\\nNext, she selects Data Processing Engine definitions for forecast processes. Cindy has already cloned and customized the predefined Data Processing Engine templates that came with the feature.\\\\n\\\\nThe four Data Processing Engine templates serve specific purposes for forecast calculations. Cindy reviews them quickly.\\\\n\\\\nName\\\\n\\\\nPurpose\\\\n\\\\nGenerate Account Forecast\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_37.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: After this, Jackie created the manufacturing program, created a Forecast Set Use record, and imported the forecast data using CSV files.\\\\n\\\\nWith the program in place, the engineering manager created relationships between Xela\\\\u2019s product variants and Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 components. And now we are here!\\\\n\\\\nIf you remember, Susan has already cloned and customized the predefined DPE definitions to suit Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 requirements. And she\\\\u2019s associated these definitions in the Xela PowerUp Components Set forecast set. Since the program is ready, her next task is to run the Data Processing Engine that can generate component forecasts.\\\\n\\\\nDPE Templates and How They Work\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing Cloud includes four DPE templates that you can use to calculate your forecasts. You can identify the DPEs by their Process Type, which is Program Based Business.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: The four predefined Data Processing Engine definitions.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s find out more about the definitions and how they work.\\\\n\\\\nData Processing Engine Template What Does It Do?\\\\n\\\\nGenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhen you generate component forecasts for the first time for a program, use this definition. Susan can also trigger it when the underlying program and variant forecast have changed since the last run and Jackie imports new forecasts for a program.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nCalculate Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nFor each period, the forecast gets calculated to give you the latest values. For Rayler Motors, this definition runs each month. Susan can also trigger it when new components are introduced, or if there are new Product Related Material records that have been created since the last run.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nRollover Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of each month, the forecast display rolls over to expire the forecast for the first period, and add another period to the display. This definition generates component forecasts for new periods.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n###\\\\nRegenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhen you make changes to the forecast set configurations or change the dimen- sions and period groups, run this definition to generate forecasts based on the updated parameters. The definition expires the existing forecast records and creates new forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe DPEs first extract data from the following object records.\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Period \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Period Group \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Set Use \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Component Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template Item \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Variant Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Period \\\\u2022 Price Book \\\\u2022 Price Book Entry \\\\u2022 Product \\\\u2022 Product Related Material\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: The Data Source nodes in the Generate Program Component Forecast Data Processing Engine definition.\\\\n\\\\nEach DPE then joins, filters, and aggregates data, applies other transformations\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nlike formulas and slices, and finally writes back the data to the Manufacturing Program Component Forecast object. The measure fields like Total Cost Per Unit, Expected Profit Per Unit, and Selling Price Per Unit are populated, along with the system-calculated Forecasted Quantity and Forecasted Revenue.\\\\n\\\\nTo automate the process of getting forecasts updated every week, Susan runs these definitions through separate scheduled Salesforce Flow definitions. When there are new programs that require new component forecasts, or existing forecasts that need recalculating, the flow triggers these processes. Susan runs a flow that generates forecasts for the new Xela PowerUp program. When the flow run is successful, she informs Jackie.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: The manufacturing program record is active and Jackie sees that she can click Import CSV to start uploading the program forecasts that she has gathered from IHS Markit. But before she imports the CSVs, she must create Forecast Set Use records.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: The Details tab of the Xela PowerUp program record.\\\\n\\\\nCreate Forecast Set Use Records\\\\n\\\\nWhen Susan defined the Forecast Set Field Mappings in a forecast set, she mapped the Forecast Set field with Advanced Account Forecast Set Use ID. What does that do? Think of the forecast set as the template that dictates how forecasts are configured and displayed. When you specify the accounts or manufacturing programs for which a particular set is used, that\\\\u2019s a Forecast Set Use record.\\\\n\\\\nJackie must create two Forecast Set Use records, one for the program and another for variants because two different forecast set configurations are used to create the forecasts at these levels. She won\\\\u2019t need to create a Forecast Set Use record for components because when the Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts, a Forecast Set Use record is automatically created by the application.\\\\n\\\\nHere are the values Jackie uses to create a Forecast Set Use record for programs.\\\\n\\\\nName: Xela Program \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Program Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\n\\\\nShe creates another Forecast Set Use record for variants with the following values.\\\\n\\\\nName: Xela Variant \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Variants Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\n\\\\nJackie can now import the CSV files.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The Advanced Account Forecast Fact Set Use record for a manufac- turing program.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Rayler Parts, a manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy machinery, is having a successful run with Manufacturing Cloud. With advanced account forecasts, the sales and operations team can create flexible and granular forecasts.

You must still create and relate a segment to those appeals and then send them, though. In this unit, you learn about tools to segment and send your appeals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou previously learned that each outreach source code represents the intersection of a message, a channel, and an audience segment. You can create a segment in many ways. For simple segments, Nonprofit Cloud includes Salesforce reports and list views. If you want more complex segments, use a tool such as Data Cloud or a data lake, or work with a third-party service provider or mailing house. No matter how you segment your audience, make sure to add the total number of people in your segment to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nyour outreach source code to calculate rollup fields like Response Rate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSegment with Data Cloud\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s our recommended solution for complex segmentation: Data Cloud.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalesforce Data Cloud is a customer data platform (CDP) that collects and stores data about your stakeholders from disparate systems. This data is used to create unified stakeholder profiles and build smart audience segments. There are many other benefits to Data Cloud\\\\u2014like better data analysis\\\\u2014but explore segmentation for now.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData Cloud helps you to create complex segments from any information and entities in the data model. For example, Annual Giving Manager Wren uses Data Cloud to create a segment of donors who:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLive in Texas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGave to HNMI\\\\u2019s food distribution programs in the past 5 years.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: A segment in Data Cloud using interest tags, gift commitments, gift transactions, and cases as criteria.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDonated at least $1,000 to HNMI in their lifetime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAren\\\\u2019t included in a major gift portfolio.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis information is spread across a donors\\\\u2019 gift transactions, outreach summary, person account, and other records. Data Cloud easily gathers information from all of those sources and makes it actionable.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nData Cloud also makes Wren\\\\u2019s segment dynamic, meaning the segment auto- matically updates as donors meet the criteria. The segment can also be linked directly to outreach source codes. When you add Data Cloud to your Salesforce org, you get access to the Market Segment object to store a segment created in Data Cloud.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData Cloud comes with Nonprofit Cloud ready to map, so your admin only has to make the connections for your data. Data Cloud segments can also be linked with other marketing automation tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about what Data Cloud can do, check out the Explore Data Cloud trail. Then, talk to your Salesforce account executive about adding it to your org.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCraft and Send Your Solicitation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCrafting a great appeal is difficult. It has to grab attention and encourage stakeholders to give. Wren spends much of their time crafting and designing these messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNonprofit Cloud works with other systems to send the message when it\\\\u2019s ready. It integrates with Marketing Cloud Engagement and other marketing automation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ntools offered by Salesforce partners.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor details about Marketing Cloud Engagement, complete the Get to Know Marketing Cloud Engagement trail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReview Campaign and Outreach Source Code Progress\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter Wren\\\\u2019s appeals go to their audiences, Wren can follow their progress with the outreach summary rollup fields that you learned about earlier in this module.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The outreach summary rollup fields on an outreach source code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOutreach summary rollups fields update automatically with data from related records on a schedule your organization defines using flows. For example, a donor decides to give because of one of Wren\\\\u2019s appeals in their campaign. Wren tracks that gift in a gift transaction record created in gift entry or through\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_32.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: This is where Data Cloud comes in. It merges Cloud Kicks customer data from different clouds and creates a single record for that customer. It reconciles all the acquired data about the customer and creates a unified customer profile so Cloud Kicks can deliver personalized and connected experiences. Data Cloud also creates customer segments that are used across different communication channels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: CRM solutions gather information about customers through various platforms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMary works with Linda Rosenberg, the loyalty program admin, to create customer segments and then plan targeted promotions for these segments. Here\\\\u2019s how they create segments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSegment Gold Tier Members\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMary wants to engage Gold tier members who haven\\\\u2019t been active recently by giving them double points for any outdoor category item that they purchase. So Mary and Linda plan a specific customer segment that includes the following members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMembers who are interested in outdoor activities. \\\\u2022 Members who have a high customer lifetime value but weren\\\\u2019t satisfied with their last customer service interaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMembers who haven\\\\u2019t visited the Cloud Kicks website in the past 30 days.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo find such members and create the segment, Linda uses both Loyalty Manage- ment data and data from other sources connected to Data Cloud. Here are the steps involved in creating the segment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConnect Loyalty Management and Data Cloud: First, Linda enables the required permission sets and provisions the Data Cloud instance. Next, she must import data from Loyalty Management into Data Cloud. Data resides in standard and custom objects, so she must enable View All and Read permissions on the objects, and Read Access for the fields in the objects. To learn more about enabling object and field permissions, check out the Enable Object and Field Permissions to Access Salesforce CRM in\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer Data Platform help\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_25.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Where: This change applies to Account Engagement Growth, Plus, Advanced, and Premium editions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUtilize Data Cloud in Account Engagement for Segmenta- tion and Personalization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConnect Account Engagement with Data Cloud to harness customer data, improve segmentation, and increase personalization.

Data Cloud segments can also be activated to a rich ecosystem of advertising partners, including Facebook (Meta) and Google.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 6: Note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn how to build segments in Data Cloud in the Segmentation and Activation module.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond marketing, Data Cloud data can be used to create experiences in Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud Personalization, and more. With Data Cloud, streaming events drive actions in various locations or targets. Data actions then use events, streaming insights, and data changes to trigger flows.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, an automotive company uses a data action to trigger an alert to create an automatic service call, when a customer\\\\u2019s vehicle crosses the 75,000-mile mark.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the next unit, we go further into use cases and share a demo.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalesforce Help: Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Bring Your Own Model \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Ingestion and Modeling in Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Customer 360 Data Model for Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Data and Identity in Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Data Cloud Insights \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Segmentation and Activation \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Glossary of Terms for Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Get Started with Data Cloud (Trailmix)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Learn How Data Cloud Works \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: learn-how-data-cloud-works \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 15 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data-cloud- powered-experiences/learn-how-data-cloud-works\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nConnect all your data sources, whether batch or streaming real-time data. \\\\u2022 Prepare your data through transformation and data governance features. \\\\u2022 Harmonize your data to a standard data model. \\\\u2022 Unify data with identity resolution rulesets. \\\\u2022 Query and analyze data using insights. \\\\u2022 Use AI to predict behavior. \\\\u2022 Analyze, expand, and act on your data in any channel. \\\\u2022 Segment audiences and create personalized experiences. \\\\u2022 Output data to multiple sources to act on data based on your business\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nneeds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nContinue to review, measure, and optimize data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConnect and Ingest Data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt all starts with bringing data into Data Cloud.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData Cloud connects to various Salesforce and external data sources, including:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: Data Cloud data and functionality diagram.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSales, Service, Commerce, and Marketing Cloud Engagement connectors \\\\u2022 Amazon S3, Google storage connectors \\\\u2022 Ingestion API and Salesforce Interaction SDK \\\\u2022 Web and Mobile connectors \\\\u2022 MuleSoft connector \\\\u2022 And more!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOverall, Data Cloud makes it easier to bring all your data, whether streaming or batch, together into Salesforce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: Note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearn more about ingestion in the Ingestion and Modeling in Data Cloud module.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTransform and Model Data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve ever spelled your name wrong in a form field, you might understand why data needs to be transformed.

And the library is based on the ingested and mapped data streams that make up your data model and the relationships created. That\\\\u2019s why it\\\\u2019s important that you spend some quality time with the person managing your data model\\\\u2014before you begin creating segments. You should work together to answer these questions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAre you using the standard data model using predefined data bundles? \\\\u2013 What attributes do those data bundles offer for segmentation? \\\\u2022 Do you want to use data from specific Marketing Cloud Engagement data extensions to create segments?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat data do you want to be cleaned?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 For example, do you want the value of \\\\u201cUnited States\\\\u201d in the country\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nattribute to be standardized to US versus U.S.?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat data sources have the most up-to-date information to be used in Identity Resolution rulesets?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 For example, your Marketing Cloud Engagement data might have the most up-to-date email, but your product orders might have the most up-to-date home address based on shipping.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow often are data sources being refreshed?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Do you need your data from a cloud storage data stream daily?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWeekly?

You must still create and relate a segment to those appeals and then send them, though. In this unit, you learn about tools to segment and send your appeals.\\\\n\\\\nYou previously learned that each outreach source code represents the intersection of a message, a channel, and an audience segment. You can create a segment in many ways. For simple segments, Nonprofit Cloud includes Salesforce reports and list views. If you want more complex segments, use a tool such as Data Cloud or a data lake, or work with a third-party service provider or mailing house. No matter how you segment your audience, make sure to add the total number of people in your segment to\\\\n\\\\nyour outreach source code to calculate rollup fields like Response Rate.\\\\n\\\\nSegment with Data Cloud\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s our recommended solution for complex segmentation: Data Cloud.\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Data Cloud is a customer data platform (CDP) that collects and stores data about your stakeholders from disparate systems. This data is used to create unified stakeholder profiles and build smart audience segments. There are many other benefits to Data Cloud\\\\u2014like better data analysis\\\\u2014but explore segmentation for now.\\\\n\\\\nData Cloud helps you to create complex segments from any information and entities in the data model. For example, Annual Giving Manager Wren uses Data Cloud to create a segment of donors who:\\\\n\\\\nLive in Texas.\\\\n\\\\nGave to HNMI\\\\u2019s food distribution programs in the past 5 years.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: A segment in Data Cloud using interest tags, gift commitments, gift transactions, and cases as criteria.\\\\n\\\\nDonated at least $1,000 to HNMI in their lifetime.\\\\n\\\\nAren\\\\u2019t included in a major gift portfolio.\\\\n\\\\nThis information is spread across a donors\\\\u2019 gift transactions, outreach summary, person account, and other records. Data Cloud easily gathers information from all of those sources and makes it actionable.\\\\n###\\\\nData Cloud also makes Wren\\\\u2019s segment dynamic, meaning the segment auto- matically updates as donors meet the criteria. The segment can also be linked directly to outreach source codes. When you add Data Cloud to your Salesforce org, you get access to the Market Segment object to store a segment created in Data Cloud.\\\\n\\\\nData Cloud comes with Nonprofit Cloud ready to map, so your admin only has to make the connections for your data. Data Cloud segments can also be linked with other marketing automation tools.\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more about what Data Cloud can do, check out the Explore Data Cloud trail. Then, talk to your Salesforce account executive about adding it to your org.\\\\n\\\\nCraft and Send Your Solicitation\\\\n\\\\nCrafting a great appeal is difficult. It has to grab attention and encourage stakeholders to give. Wren spends much of their time crafting and designing these messages.\\\\n\\\\nNonprofit Cloud works with other systems to send the message when it\\\\u2019s ready. It integrates with Marketing Cloud Engagement and other marketing automation\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\ntools offered by Salesforce partners.\\\\n\\\\nFor details about Marketing Cloud Engagement, complete the Get to Know Marketing Cloud Engagement trail.\\\\n\\\\nReview Campaign and Outreach Source Code Progress\\\\n\\\\nAfter Wren\\\\u2019s appeals go to their audiences, Wren can follow their progress with the outreach summary rollup fields that you learned about earlier in this module.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: The outreach summary rollup fields on an outreach source code.\\\\n\\\\nOutreach summary rollups fields update automatically with data from related records on a schedule your organization defines using flows. For example, a donor decides to give because of one of Wren\\\\u2019s appeals in their campaign. Wren tracks that gift in a gift transaction record created in gift entry or through\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_32.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: This is where Data Cloud comes in. It merges Cloud Kicks customer data from different clouds and creates a single record for that customer. It reconciles all the acquired data about the customer and creates a unified customer profile so Cloud Kicks can deliver personalized and connected experiences. Data Cloud also creates customer segments that are used across different communication channels.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: CRM solutions gather information about customers through various platforms.\\\\n\\\\nMary works with Linda Rosenberg, the loyalty program admin, to create customer segments and then plan targeted promotions for these segments. Here\\\\u2019s how they create segments.\\\\n\\\\nSegment Gold Tier Members\\\\n\\\\nMary wants to engage Gold tier members who haven\\\\u2019t been active recently by giving them double points for any outdoor category item that they purchase. So Mary and Linda plan a specific customer segment that includes the following members.\\\\n\\\\nMembers who are interested in outdoor activities. \\\\u2022 Members who have a high customer lifetime value but weren\\\\u2019t satisfied with their last customer service interaction.\\\\n\\\\nMembers who haven\\\\u2019t visited the Cloud Kicks website in the past 30 days.\\\\n\\\\nTo find such members and create the segment, Linda uses both Loyalty Manage- ment data and data from other sources connected to Data Cloud. Here are the steps involved in creating the segment.\\\\n\\\\nConnect Loyalty Management and Data Cloud: First, Linda enables the required permission sets and provisions the Data Cloud instance. Next, she must import data from Loyalty Management into Data Cloud. Data resides in standard and custom objects, so she must enable View All and Read permissions on the objects, and Read Access for the fields in the objects. To learn more about enabling object and field permissions, check out the Enable Object and Field Permissions to Access Salesforce CRM in\\\\n\\\\nCustomer Data Platform help\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_25.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Where: This change applies to Account Engagement Growth, Plus, Advanced, and Premium editions.\\\\n\\\\nUtilize Data Cloud in Account Engagement for Segmenta- tion and Personalization\\\\n\\\\nConnect Account Engagement with Data Cloud to harness customer data, improve segmentation, and increase personalization. Utilize Data Cloud informa- tion, based on all interactions a customer has with your company, to supercharge Account Engagement.\\\\n\\\\nCreate the Account Engagement Connector in Data Cloud. Then, in Account Engagement, create dynamic lists based on Data Cloud segments to directly market to your Data Cloud customers. Use Account Engagement to nurture, send emails, and market to your Data Cloud customers.\\\\n\\\\nThe Account Engagement Data Cloud integration allows you to connect your customer data across your tech stack, supercharging your personalized outreach.\\\\n\\\\nWhere: This change applies to all Account Engagement editions.\\\\n\\\\nQuickly Locate Unused Files in Account Engagement\\\\n\\\\nThe new Last Viewed field on the Files list view makes it easier to free up storage space when you need it. You can see the last time that someone accessed the file online or viewed it in an email or landing page. Sort the files list to find and delete unused files or to identify which files have been accessed most recently. For a consolidated view of your data, export a CSV. In the export file, use the links in the Record Location column to open the file\\\\u2019s record and easily edit or delete them.\\\\n\\\\nWhere: This change applies to all Account Engagement editions.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Keep Your Account Engagement Business Unit Running Smoothly with Optimizer\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Access Account Engagement Optimizer \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Monitor the Source of Prospect Changes \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Automate Tasks with Extensibility Enhancements\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Automate Data Sharing with Third-Party Apps \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Work with Extensibility Features | Account Engagement API | Salesforce Developers\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Act on Data\\\\n\\\\nThe magic of Data Cloud is in creating experiences that wow customers. Data Cloud offers many ways for users to act on data.\\\\n\\\\nMarketers create audience segments in Data Cloud that are used for personalized marketing campaigns within Journey Builder. Data Cloud segments can also be activated to a rich ecosystem of advertising partners, including Facebook (Meta) and Google.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 6: Note\\\\n\\\\nLearn how to build segments in Data Cloud in the Segmentation and Activation module.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond marketing, Data Cloud data can be used to create experiences in Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud Personalization, and more. With Data Cloud, streaming events drive actions in various locations or targets. Data actions then use events, streaming insights, and data changes to trigger flows.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nFor example, an automotive company uses a data action to trigger an alert to create an automatic service call, when a customer\\\\u2019s vehicle crosses the 75,000-mile mark.\\\\n\\\\nIn the next unit, we go further into use cases and share a demo.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Bring Your Own Model \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Ingestion and Modeling in Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Customer 360 Data Model for Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Data and Identity in Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Data Cloud Insights \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Segmentation and Activation \\\\u2022 Salesforce Help: Glossary of Terms for Data Cloud \\\\u2022 Trailhead: Get Started with Data Cloud (Trailmix)\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Learn How Data Cloud Works \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: learn-how-data-cloud-works \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 15 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data-cloud- powered-experiences/learn-how-data-cloud-works\\\\n###\\\\nConnect all your data sources, whether batch or streaming real-time data. \\\\u2022 Prepare your data through transformation and data governance features. \\\\u2022 Harmonize your data to a standard data model. \\\\u2022 Unify data with identity resolution rulesets. \\\\u2022 Query and analyze data using insights. \\\\u2022 Use AI to predict behavior. \\\\u2022 Analyze, expand, and act on your data in any channel. \\\\u2022 Segment audiences and create personalized experiences. \\\\u2022 Output data to multiple sources to act on data based on your business\\\\n\\\\nneeds.\\\\n\\\\nContinue to review, measure, and optimize data.\\\\n\\\\nConnect and Ingest Data\\\\n\\\\nIt all starts with bringing data into Data Cloud.\\\\n\\\\nData Cloud connects to various Salesforce and external data sources, including:\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: Data Cloud data and functionality diagram.\\\\n\\\\nSales, Service, Commerce, and Marketing Cloud Engagement connectors \\\\u2022 Amazon S3, Google storage connectors \\\\u2022 Ingestion API and Salesforce Interaction SDK \\\\u2022 Web and Mobile connectors \\\\u2022 MuleSoft connector \\\\u2022 And more!\\\\n\\\\nOverall, Data Cloud makes it easier to bring all your data, whether streaming or batch, together into Salesforce.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Note\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about ingestion in the Ingestion and Modeling in Data Cloud module.\\\\n\\\\nTransform and Model Data\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve ever spelled your name wrong in a form field, you might understand why data needs to be transformed. The good news is Data Cloud allows customers to prepare, cleanse, and transform data before it is used. Data is diverse and can look different in various sources\\\\u2014for instance, a product order, a contact in Sales Cloud, or an anonymous web browser. With Data Cloud, harmonize data from those different sources into a standard data model\\\\u2014the Customer 360\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nData Model.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Note\\\\n\\\\nExplore data mapping in the Customer 360 Data Model for Data Cloud module.\\\\n\\\\nUnify, Enhance, and Analyze Your Data\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have data in Data Cloud, you can unify customer data into one profile, enhance the data using insights and AI, create segments, and analyze it in analytics tools, such as Tableau.\\\\n\\\\nUnify Data\\\\n###\\\\nMake business decisions faster by visualizing KPIs and trends from Data Cloud reports in your dashboards. Now you can create dashboard components on a Data Cloud source report and refine the results with filters that apply to just the Data Cloud components. You can also gather insights from CRM and Data Cloud simultaneously by including both data sources in the same dashboard. For example, do a side-by-side comparison of the most successful email campaigns from Data Cloud with information on\\\\n\\\\nyour top-performing products from CRM.\\\\n\\\\nCustomize Data Model Object Record Home Pages\\\\n\\\\nGet more out of your data by customizing the record home page view for any data model object. Use the Lightning App Builder to add related lists from other DMOs, change which fields are displayed in the header or other areas of the page, and more. For example, put contact information at your users\\\\u2019 fingertips by including a unified contact point related list on the unified individual DMO record home.\\\\n\\\\nBring Your Own Lake (BYOL) Data Sharing\\\\n\\\\nSecurely share Data Cloud data with Snowflake using data shares. A data share offers Zero ETL (extract transform load) data sharing capability and allows the users to access Salesforce objects as if data is stored natively in Snowflake.\\\\n\\\\nCreate a data share and add data lake objects, data model objects, or calculated insights objects to it. Next, create a data share target to set up connectivity with a Snowflake account. Link the data share with the data share target and make the objects in the data share available in Snowflake as secure views.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Organize Your Data with Data Spaces\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Migrate to New Data Cloud Permission Sets\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Refine Access with Data Spaces Feature Permissions\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Create Autolaunched Flows Based on Data Changes in Data Cloud\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Use Data Cloud Related Lists to Enrich Your Contacts and Leads\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce Help: Copy Fields from Data Cloud to Enrich Your Contacts and Leads\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_7.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Data and Segmentation\\\\n\\\\nRemember, you use the attribute library to create segments in Data Cloud. And the library is based on the ingested and mapped data streams that make up your data model and the relationships created. That\\\\u2019s why it\\\\u2019s important that you spend some quality time with the person managing your data model\\\\u2014before you begin creating segments. You should work together to answer these questions.\\\\n\\\\nAre you using the standard data model using predefined data bundles? \\\\u2013 What attributes do those data bundles offer for segmentation? \\\\u2022 Do you want to use data from specific Marketing Cloud Engagement data extensions to create segments?\\\\n\\\\nWhat data do you want to be cleaned?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 For example, do you want the value of \\\\u201cUnited States\\\\u201d in the country\\\\n\\\\nattribute to be standardized to US versus U.S.?\\\\n\\\\nWhat data sources have the most up-to-date information to be used in Identity Resolution rulesets?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 For example, your Marketing Cloud Engagement data might have the most up-to-date email, but your product orders might have the most up-to-date home address based on shipping.\\\\n\\\\nHow often are data sources being refreshed?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Do you need your data from a cloud storage data stream daily?\\\\n\\\\nWeekly? What about Marketing Cloud Engagement data?\\\\n\\\\nSegment On\\\\n\\\\nWhen you create a new segment in Data Cloud, you first need to select what is re-\\\\n\\\\nferred to as Segment On.\\\\n\\\\nSegment On defines the target entity on which the segment builds. This is another aspect of segmentation that is dependent on your data model and what entity has been marked as \\\\u201cprofile\\\\u201d while creating data streams and data modeling. Let\\\\u2019s review two common selections for Segment On.\\\\n\\\\nIndividuals : A specific person or customer from a specific data source, like Marketing Cloud Engagement.\\\\n\\\\nUnified individual : A customer profile whose data has been merged based on multiple sources using Identity Resolution rules.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend using the unified individual.

customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlearn from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSource__c', 'content': 'FilePath__c'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSourceObject__c', 'content': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm'}, {'objectName': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'fieldName': 'FilePath__c', 'content': 'data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf'}]}, {'metadata': [{'source_object_record_id': 'combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf', 'source_object_api_name': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'link': 'https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=29b395a5ef9472b8199802403c3e5f9ceb74fa65ae4d0d15e0c588fa1c3e8a01'}], 'id': None, 'contents': [{'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'Chunk__c', 'content': 'Finally, this badge is meant to give you a high-level view of solutions involving multiple clouds.

Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations.

That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSource__c', 'content': 'FilePath__c'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSourceObject__c', 'content': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm'}, {'objectName': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'fieldName': 'FilePath__c', 'content': 'data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf'}]}, {'metadata': [{'source_object_record_id': 'combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf', 'source_object_api_name': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'link': 'https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=cf42c28fde5b5ae0360752525ba7c026530b5cb9fbba4c6b069967f76415d957'}], 'id': None, 'contents': [{'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'Chunk__c', 'content': 'Want to learn more?

Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions.

In this badge you learn about connecting B2B Commerce for Visualforce because there are more use cases to consider. (There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations. For every use case covered in this badge you learn considerations and guardrails to ensure your project is a success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Get to Know Salesforce Customers-Centric Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalesforce seeks to be customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlearn from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nWhen Sales Cloud, B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud are connected, everyone in the B2B sales process benefits. Buyers get a consistent experience from cart to payment, even when a sales rep generates a personalized quote for them. Price managers get a single system for managing products and prices. The back office gets centralized billing integration with their ERP, as well as easy-to-maintain service agreements. With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nSalesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce each have their own specialized product types and pricing methods designed to support more complex business needs. For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product. You can also synchronize other product types by extending the connector.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCPQ Product / Pricing B2B Commerce Product / Pricing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDiscount Schedules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTiered Pricing Products\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBundles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKits / Bundles / Dynamic Kits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPercent of Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct with Service Layer customization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubscription\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct with Subscription Product Term\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you can sync bundles with the connector, avoid CPQ bundles that use many options, constraints, or product rules. You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe product.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nWhen a sale reaches the ordered phase, typically the order is activated at some point. This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nPlan your Data Sync Strategy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn important part of your overall solution design is your approach to synching primary data. Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Want to learn more?

We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\n\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\n\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\n\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\n\\\\nlearn from.\\\\n\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\n\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=29b395a5ef9472b8199802403c3e5f9ceb74fa65ae4d0d15e0c588fa1c3e8a01\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Finally, this badge is meant to give you a high-level view of solutions involving multiple clouds.

(There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\n\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\n\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\n\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations.

For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\n\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\n\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product.

You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\n\\\\nthe product.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_3.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_3.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=273ead32dd11591c569b01b1793e6fca2f8c0417879d205c64c8ad5e53cb6099\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Take the experience of a large consumer goods company based in the U.S. For years, the company ran a fully staffed call center to take orders from small accounts.

That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\n\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=cf42c28fde5b5ae0360752525ba7c026530b5cb9fbba4c6b069967f76415d957\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Want to learn more?

Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\n\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\n\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=dc9a7b7b1b26e209dc5713a7e6293d816870c39dc5cb951f61841193a248137f\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Salesforce data and processes, making it easier for storefront managers to launch ecommerce sites and make optimizations quickly. |\\\\n\\\\nWhat If I Have B2B Commerce on Classic (Visualforce) Today?\\\\n\\\\nSince 2015, when Salesforce first launched Lightning Experience, many new cus- tomers started using it right away and many existing customers have transitioned to it from Classic (or Visualforce).\\\\n\\\\nBut some current B2B Customers wonder whether they must move from Visual- force to Lightning Experience.\\\\n\\\\nThe short answer is no.

(There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\n\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\n\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\n\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations. For every use case covered in this badge you learn considerations and guardrails to ensure your project is a success.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Get to Know Salesforce Customers-Centric Discovery\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce seeks to be customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\n\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\n\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\n\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\n\\\\nlearn from.\\\\n\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\n\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\\n###\\\\nWhen Sales Cloud, B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud are connected, everyone in the B2B sales process benefits. Buyers get a consistent experience from cart to payment, even when a sales rep generates a personalized quote for them. Price managers get a single system for managing products and prices. The back office gets centralized billing integration with their ERP, as well as easy-to-maintain service agreements. With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\n\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\n\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\n###\\\\nSalesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce each have their own specialized product types and pricing methods designed to support more complex business needs. For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\n\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\n\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product. You can also synchronize other product types by extending the connector.\\\\n\\\\nCPQ Product / Pricing B2B Commerce Product / Pricing\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nDiscount Schedules\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nTiered Pricing Products\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nBundles\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nKits / Bundles / Dynamic Kits\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nPercent of Total\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nProduct with Service Layer customization\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nSubscription\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nProduct with Subscription Product Term\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhile you can sync bundles with the connector, avoid CPQ bundles that use many options, constraints, or product rules. You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\n\\\\nthe product.\\\\n###\\\\nWhen a sale reaches the ordered phase, typically the order is activated at some point. This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\n\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\n\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\n\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\n\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\\n###\\\\nPlan your Data Sync Strategy\\\\n\\\\nAn important part of your overall solution design is your approach to synching primary data. Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\n\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\n\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Want to learn more?

Click 2. In the Quick Find box, enter Manufacturing, select Manufacturing. 3. Under Feature Settings, click Advanced Account Forecasting , and navigate to the Forecast Sets tab.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n, and select Setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Click New Forecast Set and provide the following details: \\\\u2022 Name: Industrial_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Industrial_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add another forecast set with the following details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Consumer_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Consumer_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 4: Note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you create a forecast set, it\\\\u2019s in an inactive state. After you define all the parameters, you can activate the set. To edit a forecast set, you must deactivate the set first, make changes, and then activate it again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrange Your Building Blocks\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy now defines the parameters for Field Mappings and Frequencies for both the forecast sets. She\\\\u2019s keeping a close eye on the sales team\\\\u2019s requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy starts with the industrial forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Click Edit on Industrial_Set record. 2. Expand the Building Blocks section. 3. Click Edit on the Field Mappings tab. 4. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nAccount: Account ID \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.

Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy repeats the configurations for the consumer forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Click Edit on Consumer_Set record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Expand the Building Blocks section. 3. Click Edit on the Field Mappings tab. 4. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAccount: Channel Name \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Click Edit on the Frequencies tab. 7. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculation Frequency: Monthly \\\\u2022 Rollover Frequency: Quarterly\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy has taken care of yet another request from the sales team. Forecasts for both business units now will be calculated monthly and rolled over quarterly. Also, the accounts for the Consumer business unit are modeled by Channel, which she added as a forecasting metric. Forecast field mappings are the structural pillars of a forecast. The required fields to create a forecast are Account, Period, Status, Forecast Quantity, Forecast Revenue, and Forecast Set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, she selects Data Processing Engine definitions for forecast processes. Cindy has already cloned and customized the predefined Data Processing Engine templates that came with the feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe four Data Processing Engine templates serve specific purposes for forecast calculations. Cindy reviews them quickly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPurpose\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerate Account Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_37.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: After this, Jackie created the manufacturing program, created a Forecast Set Use record, and imported the forecast data using CSV files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the program in place, the engineering manager created relationships between Xela\\\\u2019s product variants and Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 components. And now we are here!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you remember, Susan has already cloned and customized the predefined DPE definitions to suit Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 requirements. And she\\\\u2019s associated these definitions in the Xela PowerUp Components Set forecast set. Since the program is ready, her next task is to run the Data Processing Engine that can generate component forecasts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDPE Templates and How They Work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManufacturing Cloud includes four DPE templates that you can use to calculate your forecasts. You can identify the DPEs by their Process Type, which is Program Based Business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: The four predefined Data Processing Engine definitions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s find out more about the definitions and how they work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData Processing Engine Template What Does It Do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you generate component forecasts for the first time for a program, use this definition. Susan can also trigger it when the underlying program and variant forecast have changed since the last run and Jackie imports new forecasts for a program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor each period, the forecast gets calculated to give you the latest values. For Rayler Motors, this definition runs each month. Susan can also trigger it when new components are introduced, or if there are new Product Related Material records that have been created since the last run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRollover Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the end of each month, the forecast display rolls over to expire the forecast for the first period, and add another period to the display. This definition generates component forecasts for new periods.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nRegenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you make changes to the forecast set configurations or change the dimen- sions and period groups, run this definition to generate forecasts based on the updated parameters. The definition expires the existing forecast records and creates new forecasts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe DPEs first extract data from the following object records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Period \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Period Group \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Set Use \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Component Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template Item \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Variant Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Period \\\\u2022 Price Book \\\\u2022 Price Book Entry \\\\u2022 Product \\\\u2022 Product Related Material\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The Data Source nodes in the Generate Program Component Forecast Data Processing Engine definition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach DPE then joins, filters, and aggregates data, applies other transformations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlike formulas and slices, and finally writes back the data to the Manufacturing Program Component Forecast object. The measure fields like Total Cost Per Unit, Expected Profit Per Unit, and Selling Price Per Unit are populated, along with the system-calculated Forecasted Quantity and Forecasted Revenue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo automate the process of getting forecasts updated every week, Susan runs these definitions through separate scheduled Salesforce Flow definitions. When there are new programs that require new component forecasts, or existing forecasts that need recalculating, the flow triggers these processes. Susan runs a flow that generates forecasts for the new Xela PowerUp program. When the flow run is successful, she informs Jackie.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: The manufacturing program record is active and Jackie sees that she can click Import CSV to start uploading the program forecasts that she has gathered from IHS Markit. But before she imports the CSVs, she must create Forecast Set Use records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The Details tab of the Xela PowerUp program record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCreate Forecast Set Use Records\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Susan defined the Forecast Set Field Mappings in a forecast set, she mapped the Forecast Set field with Advanced Account Forecast Set Use ID. What does that do? Think of the forecast set as the template that dictates how forecasts are configured and displayed. When you specify the accounts or manufacturing programs for which a particular set is used, that\\\\u2019s a Forecast Set Use record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackie must create two Forecast Set Use records, one for the program and another for variants because two different forecast set configurations are used to create the forecasts at these levels. She won\\\\u2019t need to create a Forecast Set Use record for components because when the Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts, a Forecast Set Use record is automatically created by the application.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the values Jackie uses to create a Forecast Set Use record for programs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Xela Program \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Program Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShe creates another Forecast Set Use record for variants with the following values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Xela Variant \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Variants Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackie can now import the CSV files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: The Advanced Account Forecast Fact Set Use record for a manufac- turing program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Rayler Parts, a manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy machinery, is having a successful run with Manufacturing Cloud. With advanced account forecasts, the sales and operations team can create flexible and granular forecasts. The business is growing rapidly and account managers are always looking at new requirements to refine their forecast calculations further. Data Processing Engine (DPE) already helps them transform their data and automate the complex calculations that create\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\naccount forecasts, but they want more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRayler Parts sells its products through two distinct business units: Industrial and Consumer. You saw in the Advanced Account Forecasting with Manufacturing Cloud module how these business units have different forecast requirements. Cindy fulfilled the requirements by creating two forecast sets for the two business units and specifying the unit-specific configurations in each set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this module, follow Cindy as she explores the Data Processing Engine tool and learns about its role in forecasting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQuick Refresher on Advanced Account Forecasting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy\\\\u2019s starting to think more about customizing forecasts and that requires customization of the DPE templates that are used for forecast calculations. But first, she explores the basic concepts of advanced account forecasting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow does the system determine what to display on a forecast grid? The Advanced Account Forecast Set holds the configurations that determine how your forecast looks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow does the system calculate the forecast values?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe DPE definitions hold the calculation logic to compute the forecast data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhere is the forecast data stored for each period?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Advanced Account Forecast Fact object holds the forecast data for each period in a separate record. Forecast measures and dimensions are available as fields on this object.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe columns in the forecast table are the forecast dimensions. These are the parameters by which you group and aggregate the data. So, if you want to view forecast data grouped by product category and location for each period, those are your forecast dimensions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: In a forecast table, forecast measures act as the rows and the forecast dimensions act as the columns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can imagine, setting up a forecast table can be difficult. So Manufacturing Cloud provides a predefined table called the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. Think of it like a recipe for forecasts where the measures and dimensions are readily available as fields. You can use the object as-is, add new fields to it, or remove fields you don\\\\u2019t need. Further, if you want to use a custom object, you can use the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object as a reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat Is the Data Processing Engine?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo now Cindy knows that the forecast data is housed in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. The dimensions and the metrics make up the fields. But how are the values for the metrics calculated? And, how do the values get populated in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact records? That\\\\u2019s where the Data Processing Engine comes in. First, she gets familiar with a few terms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE definition is a precise recipe used to transform your data. \\\\u2022 A DPE template i s a pre-made transformation recipe. Manufacturing Cloud provides DPE templates that you can clone to get started.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE node is an ingredient or step in the recipe. Nodes can define source objects or perform actions on the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE definition runs as a job in your org, primarily via flows, to calculate forecast metric values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_7.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Define a Forecast Set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow it\\\\u2019s time for Cindy to create the forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

A forecast set is made up of the following components. We address one component at a time and show the parameters that Cindy creates for each forecast set.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding Blocks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Forecast Periods and Fact Object \\\\u2013 Forecast Fact Field Mappings \\\\u2013 Forecast Frequencies \\\\u2013 Data Processing Engine Definitions\\\\n\\\\nForecast Dimensions \\\\u2022 Forecast Measures \\\\u2022 Forecast Adjustment Periods \\\\u2022 Forecast Formulas\\\\n\\\\nCindy first creates two Forecast Set records.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The list of components that make up a forecast set.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n1. Click 2. In the Quick Find box, enter Manufacturing, select Manufacturing. 3. Under Feature Settings, click Advanced Account Forecasting , and navigate to the Forecast Sets tab.\\\\n\\\\n, and select Setup.\\\\n\\\\n4. Click New Forecast Set and provide the following details: \\\\u2022 Name: Industrial_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Industrial_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\n\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add another forecast set with the following details.\\\\n\\\\nName: Consumer_Set \\\\u2022 Period Group: Consumer_Business_Unit \\\\u2022 Forecasts Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact\\\\n\\\\nFigure 4: Note\\\\n\\\\nWhen you create a forecast set, it\\\\u2019s in an inactive state. After you define all the parameters, you can activate the set. To edit a forecast set, you must deactivate the set first, make changes, and then activate it again.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nArrange Your Building Blocks\\\\n\\\\nCindy now defines the parameters for Field Mappings and Frequencies for both the forecast sets. She\\\\u2019s keeping a close eye on the sales team\\\\u2019s requirements.\\\\n\\\\nCindy starts with the industrial forecast set.\\\\n\\\\n1. Click Edit on Industrial_Set record. 2. Expand the Building Blocks section. 3. Click Edit on the Field Mappings tab. 4. Select the following:\\\\n###\\\\nAccount: Account ID \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\n\\\\n5.

Select the following:\\\\n\\\\nAccount: Channel Name \\\\u2022 Period: Period ID \\\\u2022 Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity \\\\u2022 Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue \\\\u2022 Forecast Status: Status \\\\u2022 Forecast Set: Forecast Set Partner\\\\n\\\\n5. Click Save. 6. Click Edit on the Frequencies tab. 7. Select the following:\\\\n\\\\nCalculation Frequency: Monthly \\\\u2022 Rollover Frequency: Quarterly\\\\n\\\\n8. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nCindy has taken care of yet another request from the sales team. Forecasts for both business units now will be calculated monthly and rolled over quarterly. Also, the accounts for the Consumer business unit are modeled by Channel, which she added as a forecasting metric. Forecast field mappings are the structural pillars of a forecast. The required fields to create a forecast are Account, Period, Status, Forecast Quantity, Forecast Revenue, and Forecast Set.\\\\n\\\\nNext, she selects Data Processing Engine definitions for forecast processes. Cindy has already cloned and customized the predefined Data Processing Engine templates that came with the feature.\\\\n\\\\nThe four Data Processing Engine templates serve specific purposes for forecast calculations. Cindy reviews them quickly.\\\\n\\\\nName\\\\n\\\\nPurpose\\\\n\\\\nGenerate Account Forecast\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_37.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: After this, Jackie created the manufacturing program, created a Forecast Set Use record, and imported the forecast data using CSV files.\\\\n\\\\nWith the program in place, the engineering manager created relationships between Xela\\\\u2019s product variants and Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 components. And now we are here!\\\\n\\\\nIf you remember, Susan has already cloned and customized the predefined DPE definitions to suit Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 requirements. And she\\\\u2019s associated these definitions in the Xela PowerUp Components Set forecast set. Since the program is ready, her next task is to run the Data Processing Engine that can generate component forecasts.\\\\n\\\\nDPE Templates and How They Work\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing Cloud includes four DPE templates that you can use to calculate your forecasts. You can identify the DPEs by their Process Type, which is Program Based Business.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: The four predefined Data Processing Engine definitions.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s find out more about the definitions and how they work.\\\\n\\\\nData Processing Engine Template What Does It Do?\\\\n\\\\nGenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhen you generate component forecasts for the first time for a program, use this definition. Susan can also trigger it when the underlying program and variant forecast have changed since the last run and Jackie imports new forecasts for a program.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nCalculate Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nFor each period, the forecast gets calculated to give you the latest values. For Rayler Motors, this definition runs each month. Susan can also trigger it when new components are introduced, or if there are new Product Related Material records that have been created since the last run.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nRollover Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of each month, the forecast display rolls over to expire the forecast for the first period, and add another period to the display. This definition generates component forecasts for new periods.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n###\\\\nRegenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhen you make changes to the forecast set configurations or change the dimen- sions and period groups, run this definition to generate forecasts based on the updated parameters. The definition expires the existing forecast records and creates new forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe DPEs first extract data from the following object records.\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Period \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Period Group \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecast Set Use \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Component Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Template Item \\\\u2022 Manufacturing Program Variant Forecast Fact \\\\u2022 Period \\\\u2022 Price Book \\\\u2022 Price Book Entry \\\\u2022 Product \\\\u2022 Product Related Material\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: The Data Source nodes in the Generate Program Component Forecast Data Processing Engine definition.\\\\n\\\\nEach DPE then joins, filters, and aggregates data, applies other transformations\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nlike formulas and slices, and finally writes back the data to the Manufacturing Program Component Forecast object. The measure fields like Total Cost Per Unit, Expected Profit Per Unit, and Selling Price Per Unit are populated, along with the system-calculated Forecasted Quantity and Forecasted Revenue.\\\\n\\\\nTo automate the process of getting forecasts updated every week, Susan runs these definitions through separate scheduled Salesforce Flow definitions. When there are new programs that require new component forecasts, or existing forecasts that need recalculating, the flow triggers these processes. Susan runs a flow that generates forecasts for the new Xela PowerUp program. When the flow run is successful, she informs Jackie.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: The manufacturing program record is active and Jackie sees that she can click Import CSV to start uploading the program forecasts that she has gathered from IHS Markit. But before she imports the CSVs, she must create Forecast Set Use records.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: The Details tab of the Xela PowerUp program record.\\\\n\\\\nCreate Forecast Set Use Records\\\\n\\\\nWhen Susan defined the Forecast Set Field Mappings in a forecast set, she mapped the Forecast Set field with Advanced Account Forecast Set Use ID. What does that do? Think of the forecast set as the template that dictates how forecasts are configured and displayed. When you specify the accounts or manufacturing programs for which a particular set is used, that\\\\u2019s a Forecast Set Use record.\\\\n\\\\nJackie must create two Forecast Set Use records, one for the program and another for variants because two different forecast set configurations are used to create the forecasts at these levels. She won\\\\u2019t need to create a Forecast Set Use record for components because when the Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts, a Forecast Set Use record is automatically created by the application.\\\\n\\\\nHere are the values Jackie uses to create a Forecast Set Use record for programs.\\\\n\\\\nName: Xela Program \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Program Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\n\\\\nShe creates another Forecast Set Use record for variants with the following values.\\\\n\\\\nName: Xela Variant \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Variants Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\n\\\\nJackie can now import the CSV files.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The Advanced Account Forecast Fact Set Use record for a manufac- turing program.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Rayler Parts, a manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy machinery, is having a successful run with Manufacturing Cloud. With advanced account forecasts, the sales and operations team can create flexible and granular forecasts.

This permission set helps admins create, customize, run, and monitor the data processing engine definitions.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The permission sets required for a user to manage program-based 6 business.\\\\n###\\\\nJackie\\\\u2019s Requirements How Can Manufacturing Cloud Help?\\\\n\\\\nI want to import production forecast data into the org from an external source for program and variant forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nAccount managers can import program and variant forecast data from third-party research into the org using CSV files.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want to create multiple programs with the same inherent set of configurations and structure.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe admin can create program templates and template items to define the set of forecast configurations for each level. The templates can then be used to create multiple programs.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want the program, variant, and component-level forecasts to be aggregated by different dimensions, such as Car Model and Production Plant.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe predefined Manufacturing Program Forecast Fact objects come with fields that can be used as dimensions. And admins can always define their own dimensions.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want an easy way to view the relationship between my account\\\\u2019s products and the related components that we manufacture.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nEngineering managers can relate the supplier components with the end-product and provide additional details, such as lead time and cost per unit.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want to automate the calculation of component-level forecasts based on data derived from the program and variant-level forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nData Processing Engine (DPE) templates come out of the box and can be used to calculate, generate, roll over, and regenerate component forecasts. The calculation logic and data transformation conditions can be customized as per the company\\\\u2019s requirements. DPEs can be triggered through scheduled flows.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n ###\\\\nQUESTION:\\\\nWhen Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts for a manufacturing program, is a Forecast Set Use record automatically created?\\\\n\\\\n ###\\\\nResponse:\\\\n\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"Policy\\\", \\\"scope\\\": \\\"Global\\\", \\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"layer\\\": \\\"Post\\\", \\\"languageScope\\\": null, \\\"content\\\": \\\"You must generate the output in ENGLISH\\\\nFollow this tone and style guideline when crafting your output: \\\\nExpress professionalism with deontic modality and declarative sentences. \\\\n Default to periods for punctuation, only ask questions when necessary. \\\\n Do not use intensifiers.

customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlearn from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSource__c', 'content': 'FilePath__c'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSourceObject__c', 'content': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm'}, {'objectName': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'fieldName': 'FilePath__c', 'content': 'data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf'}]}, {'metadata': [{'source_object_record_id': 'combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf', 'source_object_api_name': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'link': 'https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_38.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=29b395a5ef9472b8199802403c3e5f9ceb74fa65ae4d0d15e0c588fa1c3e8a01'}], 'id': None, 'contents': [{'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'Chunk__c', 'content': 'Finally, this badge is meant to give you a high-level view of solutions involving multiple clouds.

Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations.

The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options.

Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions.

Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations. For every use case covered in this badge you learn considerations and guardrails to ensure your project is a success.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Get to Know Salesforce Customers-Centric Discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalesforce seeks to be customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nlearn from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nWhen Sales Cloud, B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud are connected, everyone in the B2B sales process benefits. Buyers get a consistent experience from cart to payment, even when a sales rep generates a personalized quote for them. Price managers get a single system for managing products and prices. The back office gets centralized billing integration with their ERP, as well as easy-to-maintain service agreements. With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nSalesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce each have their own specialized product types and pricing methods designed to support more complex business needs. For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product. You can also synchronize other product types by extending the connector.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCPQ Product / Pricing B2B Commerce Product / Pricing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDiscount Schedules\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTiered Pricing Products\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBundles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKits / Bundles / Dynamic Kits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPercent of Total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct with Service Layer customization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSubscription\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct with Subscription Product Term\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you can sync bundles with the connector, avoid CPQ bundles that use many options, constraints, or product rules. You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe product.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nWhen a sale reaches the ordered phase, typically the order is activated at some point. This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nPlan your Data Sync Strategy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn important part of your overall solution design is your approach to synching primary data. Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Want to learn more?

In this badge you learn about connecting B2B Commerce for Visualforce because there are more use cases to consider. (There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\n\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\n\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\n\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations.

For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\n\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\n\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product.

This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\n\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\n\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\n\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\n\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=cf42c28fde5b5ae0360752525ba7c026530b5cb9fbba4c6b069967f76415d957\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Want to learn more?

Each channel has its own\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\n\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T063053Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=dc9a7b7b1b26e209dc5713a7e6293d816870c39dc5cb951f61841193a248137f\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Salesforce data and processes, making it easier for storefront managers to launch ecommerce sites and make optimizations quickly. |\\\\n\\\\nWhat If I Have B2B Commerce on Classic (Visualforce) Today?\\\\n\\\\nSince 2015, when Salesforce first launched Lightning Experience, many new cus- tomers started using it right away and many existing customers have transitioned to it from Classic (or Visualforce).\\\\n\\\\nBut some current B2B Customers wonder whether they must move from Visual- force to Lightning Experience.\\\\n\\\\nThe short answer is no.

In this badge you learn about connecting B2B Commerce for Visualforce because there are more use cases to consider. (There\\\\u2019s a similar connector for B2B Commerce Lightning Experience that supports some of the same use cases.)\\\\n\\\\nThe Visualforce connector is a package that you can find on AppExchange, built to give you a launching pad for meeting some of the most commonly requested use cases involving integration between B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud. In this badge, we take a close look at five of these use cases.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize a single source of truth for product and pricing data between Salesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nConvert a B2B Commerce Cart into a Salesforce CPQ Quote for special handling by a sales rep.\\\\n\\\\nSynchronize CPQ and B2B Commerce orders so buyers can do their own self-service reorders regardless of how the order was created.\\\\n\\\\nExpose Salesforce Billing to the self-service buying experience for consoli- dated, yet flexible invoicing options.\\\\n\\\\nEasily generate Sales Agreements from known data on the CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nBy design, the connector gives you full access to the source code, allowing you to modify and extend the functionality to support nuances specific to your customer. Also, each of the connector\\\\u2019s functions can be enabled or disabled as you see fit.\\\\n\\\\nThe connector saves your implementation team a ton of time tying together clouds since they don\\\\u2019t have to build the integrations from scratch. Additionally, the connector promotes patterns and best practices for long-term success. For example, there\\\\u2019s a built-in logging mechanism so you can monitor exactly what\\\\u2019s happening when synchronizations occur.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, for all the connector offers, it\\\\u2019s still important to understand its limitations. For every use case covered in this badge you learn considerations and guardrails to ensure your project is a success.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_36.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Get to Know Salesforce Customers-Centric Discovery\\\\n\\\\nSalesforce seeks to be customer-centric in the way we work with our customers. We partnered with Somersault Innovation to help us design our model for dis- covery and use the principles of design thinking. Our customer-centric discovery (CCD) begins with know the customer. In this stage, we use our existing tools such as 10K advisors reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry reports to orient ourselves toward our customer\\\\u2019s business.\\\\n\\\\nThen, we seek ways to be the customer by finding ways to walk in our customer\\\\u2019s customer\\\\u2019s shoes. This can involve visiting a physical or virtual store, calling into customer service lines, or interviewing businesses who buy from our customer. We use these perspectives to connect with the customer and show them our genuine interest in their business. We work with them to create a vision they care about before we move ahead and co-create a path forward.\\\\n\\\\nUse CCD for Your Business\\\\n\\\\nThese principles can apply both in business to customer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) organizations. After all, every business has its customers. You can likely identify several different types of end customers and then decide which ones to focus on to conduct your discovery. Sellers use practical criteria to determine where to focus, such as which customers they can easily access, as well as creative criteria such as which end customers would be the most interesting to experience and\\\\n\\\\nlearn from.\\\\n\\\\nCheck Out CCD in Action\\\\n\\\\nOne account executive applied CCD to a retail greeting card company that she knew, from its 10K report, was interested in growing its business with millennial customers. She visited its stores, and she downloaded the company\\\\u2019s app, seeking to make online purchases. She learned a number of insightful things that millennials would find important and used these insights to gain the interest of the greeting card executive team.\\\\n###\\\\nWhen Sales Cloud, B2B Commerce, Revenue Cloud, and Manufacturing Cloud are connected, everyone in the B2B sales process benefits. Buyers get a consistent experience from cart to payment, even when a sales rep generates a personalized quote for them. Price managers get a single system for managing products and prices. The back office gets centralized billing integration with their ERP, as well as easy-to-maintain service agreements. With the help of the connector and some customization work to\\\\n\\\\nextend its functionality for the nuances of your customer, you can transform a multi-cloud suite of products into a true Customer 360 solution.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Link Cart to Cash \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Orders for Easy Reorders and Billing \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and-billing \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-orders-for-easy-reorders-and- billing\\\\n\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Shopping Cart Integrations for B2B Companies \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: shopping-cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Architect, Filter-API-name: architect \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business-to-Business (B2B) Sales, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nbusiness-to-business_b2b_sales\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Commerce Cloud, Filter-API-name: commercecloud \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Process Improvement and Optimization, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: process_improvement_and_optimization \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Sales Cloud, Filter-API-name: sales \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\n###\\\\nSalesforce CPQ and B2B Commerce each have their own specialized product types and pricing methods designed to support more complex business needs. For example, each has a method of handling volume-based pricing. CPQ uses discount schedules, B2B Commerce uses Tier Pricing. In order to keep complex products like these in sync, extend the connector beyond its out-of-the-box capabilities. You can modify the code to build upon the connection it already creates between Product2 and CC Product records.\\\\n\\\\nTo support additional product types, extend the data model and connector to synchronize a Product Type field between the Product2 and CC Product records. Use this field to indicate what kind of special treatment the extended connector applies. In the case of volume-based pricing, the pricing manager sets Product Type to \\\\u201cTier Priced Product.\\\\u201d Then, extend the connector to evaluate the Product Type, and when appropriate, publish the known discount schedule data from the source product in CPQ to\\\\n\\\\nthe Price Tiers field on the CC Price List Item record in B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one example of how you can extend the connector to handle a more complex product. You can also synchronize other product types by extending the connector.\\\\n\\\\nCPQ Product / Pricing B2B Commerce Product / Pricing\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nDiscount Schedules\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nTiered Pricing Products\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nBundles\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nKits / Bundles / Dynamic Kits\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nPercent of Total\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nProduct with Service Layer customization\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nSubscription\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nProduct with Subscription Product Term\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nWhile you can sync bundles with the connector, avoid CPQ bundles that use many options, constraints, or product rules. You can extend the connector to handle complicated bundles, but these require much more customization than other product types. Also, there are some product and pricing methods that are not supported with the connector, such as CPQ\\\\u2019s Block Pricing. In those cases, a sales rep must be involved to create the quote and bring it to an order since there is no self-service version of\\\\n\\\\nthe product.\\\\n###\\\\nWhen a sale reaches the ordered phase, typically the order is activated at some point. This is a good time to trigger automation to check the Sync to B2B Orders field on the order. The connector package adds the Sync to B2B Orders field to the CPQ Order object, but you need to develop the automation to best fit your sales process.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Swim lane diagram of CPQ Order to CC Order handoff.\\\\n\\\\nAs with other connector functions, the sync is logged as a CPQB2B Log record.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nSync a B2B Commerce Order to a CPQ Order\\\\n\\\\nWhen Salesforce Billing is part of a multi-cloud solution, any order that\\\\u2019s generated from a CPQ quote is more than just a tool for tracking commitments. The order is the connection point between CPQ and Billing, and it\\\\u2019s the basis for invoice generation. Furthermore, Billing creates detailed transactional data to support revenue recognition, financial reporting, and back-office functions such as accounts receivable and payment adjustments. This data is often used as the centralized billing\\\\n\\\\nintegration point to the ERP.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem Ursa Major must solve is that CC Order records generated in the self-service channel are not connected to Salesforce Billing in any way. That means B2B order data can\\\\u2019t be shared with the ERP through the centralized integration point of Billing, and self-service buyers can\\\\u2019t benefit from powerful recurring and usage-based billing options. The good news is that the connector can help bridge this gap by using known CC Order data to create a twin CPQ Order record, which then connects to\\\\n\\\\nBilling. We recommend using the CPQ Order record as the bridge between B2B Commerce and Billing, and not to integrate them directly through customization.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s take a close look at what the connector does when a buyer checks out a cart from the self-service storefront.\\\\n###\\\\nPlan your Data Sync Strategy\\\\n\\\\nAn important part of your overall solution design is your approach to synching primary data. Synchronization is typically handled in bulk, so be mindful of governor limits. The connector gives you the option to use platform events, scheduled batch classes, or a queueable framework for synchronization. Your approach depends on factors such as volume of data, frequency of changes, integrated systems and other data flows, and performance requirements.\\\\n\\\\nSince B2B Commerce records will likely be created through an automated synchronization process, consider creating a validation rule that prevents the manual creation of CC Product and CC Price List Item records.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\\\u2019s one pricing-related element you should not use the connector to synchronize, and that\\\\u2019s discounting and promotions. Each channel has its own\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nway of handling these adjustments in the transactional data, so there\\\\u2019s no need to account for them in the primary data.\\\\n\\\\nHaving consistent product and pricing data across channels is not just important for pricing managers, it\\\\u2019s also a prerequisite for implementing other cross-cloud use cases such as the one you learn about in the next unit: converting a storefront shopping cart into a CPQ quote.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nCustomer 360 Guide: Synchronize Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 CPQ & B2B Commerce for Visualforce Connector Documentation\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Sync Product and Pricing Data \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: sync-product-and-pricing-data \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 10 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/shopping- cart-integrations-for-b2b-companies/sync-product-and-pricing-data\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_6.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Want to learn more?

Salesforce will continue to support the Visualforce deployment option. Customers do not need to move, and Salesforce will continue to support and innovate on Visualforce.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, once you get to know the Lightning Experience options, you can design a thoughtful transition from the existing user interface that reevaluates existing customizations and eliminates old problems. Then you\\\\u2019re armed with the data to make a compelling case to your leadership and other decision makers to implement this transition.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s Sum It Up\\\\n\\\\nIn this unit, you learned what it means for B2B Commerce to be on the amazing Lightning Experience. You explored features and benefits, and how to transition to Lightning Experience on B2B Commerce.\\\\n\\\\nNow take this last quiz and earn another badge!\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nTrailhead: Personalized Email Marketing \\\\u2022 _Trailhead: _Lightning Experience Basics\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Explore B2B Commerce on Lightning Experience \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 5 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: commerce-basics/explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Explore B2B Commerce on Lightning Experience \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 5 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: commerce-basics/explore-b2b-commerce-on-lightning-experience\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_3.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Take the experience of a large consumer goods company based in the U.S. For years, the company ran a fully staffed call center to take orders from small accounts. When it added digital commerce, the team expected to streamline processes and cut costs. But as the company analyzed sales, it was pleasantly surprised to see that revenue per customer was increasing steadily, as well. In fact, customers liked ordering on their own and responded more readily to\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nautomated cross-selling messaging than to the call center reps. That feedback gave the company confidence to invest in enhancements to its landing page and build more sophisticated cross-sell and upsell capabilities.\\\\n\\\\nOK, so let\\\\u2019s assume you\\\\u2019ve now got a clear idea of the change you\\\\u2019d like to bring about that better serves the expectations and needs of your customers.

The required fields to create a forecast are Account, Period, Status, Forecast Quantity, Forecast Revenue, and Forecast Set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, she selects Data Processing Engine definitions for forecast processes. Cindy has already cloned and customized the predefined Data Processing Engine templates that came with the feature.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe four Data Processing Engine templates serve specific purposes for forecast calculations. Cindy reviews them quickly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPurpose\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerate Account Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_37.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: After this, Jackie created the manufacturing program, created a Forecast Set Use record, and imported the forecast data using CSV files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the program in place, the engineering manager created relationships between Xela\\\\u2019s product variants and Rayler Motors\\\\u2019 components.

And she\\\\u2019s associated these definitions in the Xela PowerUp Components Set forecast set. Since the program is ready, her next task is to run the Data Processing Engine that can generate component forecasts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDPE Templates and How They Work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManufacturing Cloud includes four DPE templates that you can use to calculate your forecasts. You can identify the DPEs by their Process Type, which is Program Based Business.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: The four predefined Data Processing Engine definitions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s find out more about the definitions and how they work.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData Processing Engine Template What Does It Do?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you generate component forecasts for the first time for a program, use this definition. Susan can also trigger it when the underlying program and variant forecast have changed since the last run and Jackie imports new forecasts for a program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor each period, the forecast gets calculated to give you the latest values. For Rayler Motors, this definition runs each month. Susan can also trigger it when new components are introduced, or if there are new Product Related Material records that have been created since the last run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRollover Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the end of each month, the forecast display rolls over to expire the forecast for the first period, and add another period to the display. This definition generates component forecasts for new periods.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nRegenerate Program Component Forecast\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you make changes to the forecast set configurations or change the dimen- sions and period groups, run this definition to generate forecasts based on the updated parameters.

When there are new programs that require new component forecasts, or existing forecasts that need recalculating, the flow triggers these processes. Susan runs a flow that generates forecasts for the new Xela PowerUp program. When the flow run is successful, she informs Jackie.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: The manufacturing program record is active and Jackie sees that she can click Import CSV to start uploading the program forecasts that she has gathered from IHS Markit. But before she imports the CSVs, she must create Forecast Set Use records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The Details tab of the Xela PowerUp program record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCreate Forecast Set Use Records\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Susan defined the Forecast Set Field Mappings in a forecast set, she mapped the Forecast Set field with Advanced Account Forecast Set Use ID. What does that do? Think of the forecast set as the template that dictates how forecasts are configured and displayed. When you specify the accounts or manufacturing programs for which a particular set is used, that\\\\u2019s a Forecast Set Use record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackie must create two Forecast Set Use records, one for the program and another for variants because two different forecast set configurations are used to create the forecasts at these levels. She won\\\\u2019t need to create a Forecast Set Use record for components because when the Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts, a Forecast Set Use record is automatically created by the application.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are the values Jackie uses to create a Forecast Set Use record for programs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Xela Program \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Program Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShe creates another Forecast Set Use record for variants with the following values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nName: Xela Variant \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Variants Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackie can now import the CSV files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: The Advanced Account Forecast Fact Set Use record for a manufac- turing program.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Rayler Parts, a manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy machinery, is having a successful run with Manufacturing Cloud. With advanced account forecasts, the sales and operations team can create flexible and granular forecasts. The business is growing rapidly and account managers are always looking at new requirements to refine their forecast calculations further. Data Processing Engine (DPE) already helps them transform their data and automate the complex calculations that create\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\naccount forecasts, but they want more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRayler Parts sells its products through two distinct business units: Industrial and Consumer. You saw in the Advanced Account Forecasting with Manufacturing Cloud module how these business units have different forecast requirements. Cindy fulfilled the requirements by creating two forecast sets for the two business units and specifying the unit-specific configurations in each set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this module, follow Cindy as she explores the Data Processing Engine tool and learns about its role in forecasting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQuick Refresher on Advanced Account Forecasting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCindy\\\\u2019s starting to think more about customizing forecasts and that requires customization of the DPE templates that are used for forecast calculations. But first, she explores the basic concepts of advanced account forecasting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow does the system determine what to display on a forecast grid? The Advanced Account Forecast Set holds the configurations that determine how your forecast looks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow does the system calculate the forecast values?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe DPE definitions hold the calculation logic to compute the forecast data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhere is the forecast data stored for each period?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Advanced Account Forecast Fact object holds the forecast data for each period in a separate record. Forecast measures and dimensions are available as fields on this object.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe columns in the forecast table are the forecast dimensions. These are the parameters by which you group and aggregate the data. So, if you want to view forecast data grouped by product category and location for each period, those are your forecast dimensions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: In a forecast table, forecast measures act as the rows and the forecast dimensions act as the columns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can imagine, setting up a forecast table can be difficult. So Manufacturing Cloud provides a predefined table called the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. Think of it like a recipe for forecasts where the measures and dimensions are readily available as fields. You can use the object as-is, add new fields to it, or remove fields you don\\\\u2019t need. Further, if you want to use a custom object, you can use the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object as a reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat Is the Data Processing Engine?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo now Cindy knows that the forecast data is housed in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. The dimensions and the metrics make up the fields. But how are the values for the metrics calculated? And, how do the values get populated in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact records? That\\\\u2019s where the Data Processing Engine comes in. First, she gets familiar with a few terms.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE definition is a precise recipe used to transform your data. \\\\u2022 A DPE template i s a pre-made transformation recipe. Manufacturing Cloud provides DPE templates that you can clone to get started.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE node is an ingredient or step in the recipe. Nodes can define source objects or perform actions on the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA DPE definition runs as a job in your org, primarily via flows, to calculate forecast metric values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_7.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Define a Forecast Set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow it\\\\u2019s time for Cindy to create the forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. In Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Manufacturing, and select Manu- facturing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Under Feature Settings, click Advanced Account Forecasting , and navigate to the Forecast Sets tab. 3. Click New and provide these details. 4. Name: Forecast Set for AMER Sales 5. Period Group: Period Group for AMER Sales 6. Forecast Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact 7. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: The New forecast set window\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, Cindy maps the fields required to generate forecasts with the fields in the org that must be used to populate the values in the forecast.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Expand the Building Blocks section. 2. On the Forecast Fact Field Mappings tab, click Edit. 3. Select the following: 4. Account: Account ID 5. Period: Period ID 6. Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity 7. Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue 8. Forecast Status: Status 9. Forecast Set: Advanced Account Forecast Set Partner ID 10. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, Cindy defines the frequency at which the forecast is updated. She also defines the frequency at which new periods are added and the display rolls over.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. On the Forecast Frequencies tab, click Edit. 2. Select the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: The forecast fact field mappings in a forecast set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Calculation Frequency: Monthly 4. Rollover Frequency: Quarterly 5. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: The forecast frequencies in a forecast set\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA template is the predefined definition that comes with Manufacturing Cloud. To use the template, the admin must clone it to create a definition. Then, the admin can make changes to the definition and activate it. Cindy\\\\u2019s already cloned the four predefined DPE templates for Advanced Account Forecasting and activated them. She\\\\u2019s also added the suffix \\\\u201c_AMER Sales Forecasts\\\\u201d to the names of the cloned DPE definitions to differentiate them from the templates. See Clone Data Processing Engine\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTemplates for details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_18.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: I want to view data such as the market share percentage of each product variant, the total fixed and variable cost of each component we\\\\u2019ll supply, and the expected profit percent on each component.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Forecast Fact objects for manufacturing programs, variants, and components come with a set of fields that can be defined as forecast measures in a forecast set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the forecast is approved and finalized, I want to convert it into an opportunity, and finally into an agreement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Transformation API packaged with Manufacturing Cloud helps you convert forecast records into Opportunity records. The Sales Agreement API allows you to then convert these Opportunity records into Sales Agreement records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of this sounds very promising, and Susan is excited!

She won\\\\u2019t need to create a Forecast Set Use record for components because when the Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts, a Forecast Set Use record is automatically created by the application.\\\\n\\\\nHere are the values Jackie uses to create a Forecast Set Use record for programs.\\\\n\\\\nName: Xela Program \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Program Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\n\\\\nShe creates another Forecast Set Use record for variants with the following values.\\\\n\\\\nName: Xela Variant \\\\u2022 Forecast Context: Manufacturing Program: Xela PowerUp \\\\u2022 Advanced Account Forecast Set: Xela PowerUp Variants Set \\\\u2022 Status: Active\\\\n\\\\nJackie can now import the CSV files.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The Advanced Account Forecast Fact Set Use record for a manufac- turing program.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_24.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Rayler Parts, a manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy machinery, is having a successful run with Manufacturing Cloud. With advanced account forecasts, the sales and operations team can create flexible and granular forecasts. The business is growing rapidly and account managers are always looking at new requirements to refine their forecast calculations further. Data Processing Engine (DPE) already helps them transform their data and automate the complex calculations that create\\\\n\\\\naccount forecasts, but they want more.\\\\n\\\\nRayler Parts sells its products through two distinct business units: Industrial and Consumer. You saw in the Advanced Account Forecasting with Manufacturing Cloud module how these business units have different forecast requirements. Cindy fulfilled the requirements by creating two forecast sets for the two business units and specifying the unit-specific configurations in each set.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nIn this module, follow Cindy as she explores the Data Processing Engine tool and learns about its role in forecasting.\\\\n\\\\nQuick Refresher on Advanced Account Forecasting\\\\n\\\\nCindy\\\\u2019s starting to think more about customizing forecasts and that requires customization of the DPE templates that are used for forecast calculations. But first, she explores the basic concepts of advanced account forecasting.\\\\n\\\\nHow does the system determine what to display on a forecast grid? The Advanced Account Forecast Set holds the configurations that determine how your forecast looks.\\\\n\\\\nHow does the system calculate the forecast values?\\\\n\\\\nThe DPE definitions hold the calculation logic to compute the forecast data.\\\\n\\\\nWhere is the forecast data stored for each period?\\\\n\\\\nThe Advanced Account Forecast Fact object holds the forecast data for each period in a separate record. Forecast measures and dimensions are available as fields on this object.\\\\n###\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nThe columns in the forecast table are the forecast dimensions. These are the parameters by which you group and aggregate the data. So, if you want to view forecast data grouped by product category and location for each period, those are your forecast dimensions.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: In a forecast table, forecast measures act as the rows and the forecast dimensions act as the columns.\\\\n\\\\nAs you can imagine, setting up a forecast table can be difficult. So Manufacturing Cloud provides a predefined table called the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. Think of it like a recipe for forecasts where the measures and dimensions are readily available as fields. You can use the object as-is, add new fields to it, or remove fields you don\\\\u2019t need. Further, if you want to use a custom object, you can use the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object as a reference.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is the Data Processing Engine?\\\\n\\\\nSo now Cindy knows that the forecast data is housed in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact object. The dimensions and the metrics make up the fields. But how are the values for the metrics calculated? And, how do the values get populated in the Advanced Account Forecast Fact records? That\\\\u2019s where the Data Processing Engine comes in. First, she gets familiar with a few terms.\\\\n\\\\nA DPE definition is a precise recipe used to transform your data. \\\\u2022 A DPE template i s a pre-made transformation recipe. Manufacturing Cloud provides DPE templates that you can clone to get started.\\\\n\\\\nA DPE node is an ingredient or step in the recipe. Nodes can define source objects or perform actions on the data.\\\\n\\\\nA DPE definition runs as a job in your org, primarily via flows, to calculate forecast metric values.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_7.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Define a Forecast Set\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\\\u2019s time for Cindy to create the forecast set.\\\\n\\\\n1. In Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Manufacturing, and select Manu- facturing.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n2. Under Feature Settings, click Advanced Account Forecasting , and navigate to the Forecast Sets tab. 3. Click New and provide these details. 4. Name: Forecast Set for AMER Sales 5. Period Group: Period Group for AMER Sales 6. Forecast Facts Object: Advanced Account Forecast Fact 7. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: The New forecast set window\\\\n\\\\nNext, Cindy maps the fields required to generate forecasts with the fields in the org that must be used to populate the values in the forecast.\\\\n\\\\n1. Expand the Building Blocks section. 2. On the Forecast Fact Field Mappings tab, click Edit. 3. Select the following: 4. Account: Account ID 5. Period: Period ID 6. Forecast Quantity: Forecasted Quantity 7. Forecast Revenue: Forecasted Revenue 8. Forecast Status: Status 9. Forecast Set: Advanced Account Forecast Set Partner ID 10. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nNow, Cindy defines the frequency at which the forecast is updated. She also defines the frequency at which new periods are added and the display rolls over.\\\\n\\\\n1. On the Forecast Frequencies tab, click Edit. 2. Select the following:\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: The forecast fact field mappings in a forecast set\\\\n\\\\n3. Calculation Frequency: Monthly 4. Rollover Frequency: Quarterly 5. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The forecast frequencies in a forecast set\\\\n\\\\nA template is the predefined definition that comes with Manufacturing Cloud. To use the template, the admin must clone it to create a definition. Then, the admin can make changes to the definition and activate it. Cindy\\\\u2019s already cloned the four predefined DPE templates for Advanced Account Forecasting and activated them. She\\\\u2019s also added the suffix \\\\u201c_AMER Sales Forecasts\\\\u201d to the names of the cloned DPE definitions to differentiate them from the templates. See Clone Data Processing Engine\\\\n\\\\nTemplates for details.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_18.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: I want to view data such as the market share percentage of each product variant, the total fixed and variable cost of each component we\\\\u2019ll supply, and the expected profit percent on each component.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe Forecast Fact objects for manufacturing programs, variants, and components come with a set of fields that can be defined as forecast measures in a forecast set.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nWhen the forecast is approved and finalized, I want to convert it into an opportunity, and finally into an agreement.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe Transformation API packaged with Manufacturing Cloud helps you convert forecast records into Opportunity records. The Sales Agreement API allows you to then convert these Opportunity records into Sales Agreement records.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nAll of this sounds very promising, and Susan is excited! Let\\\\u2019s find out what Susan does to set up the Program Based Business feature.\\\\n\\\\nAssign Permissions\\\\n\\\\nSusan enables the following features in the org.\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced Account Forecasting \\\\u2022 Data Pipelines \\\\u2022 Program Based Business\\\\n\\\\nNext, Susan assigns the following permission sets to Jackie so that Jackie can access the objects for program-based business and manage forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Program Based Business feature enabled in Setup.\\\\n\\\\nPermission Sets Description\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing Advanced Account Forecast\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nHelps users create forecast sets that hold the configurations for program, variant, and component forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing Program Based Business\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nHelps users create manufacturing programs from templates.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nSusan also assigns the Data Pipelines Base User permission set to the System Administrator profile. This permission set helps admins create, customize, run, and monitor the data processing engine definitions.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The permission sets required for a user to manage program-based 6 business.\\\\n###\\\\nJackie\\\\u2019s Requirements How Can Manufacturing Cloud Help?\\\\n\\\\nI want to import production forecast data into the org from an external source for program and variant forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nAccount managers can import program and variant forecast data from third-party research into the org using CSV files.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want to create multiple programs with the same inherent set of configurations and structure.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe admin can create program templates and template items to define the set of forecast configurations for each level. The templates can then be used to create multiple programs.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want the program, variant, and component-level forecasts to be aggregated by different dimensions, such as Car Model and Production Plant.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThe predefined Manufacturing Program Forecast Fact objects come with fields that can be used as dimensions. And admins can always define their own dimensions.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want an easy way to view the relationship between my account\\\\u2019s products and the related components that we manufacture.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nEngineering managers can relate the supplier components with the end-product and provide additional details, such as lead time and cost per unit.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nI want to automate the calculation of component-level forecasts based on data derived from the program and variant-level forecasts.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nData Processing Engine (DPE) templates come out of the box and can be used to calculate, generate, roll over, and regenerate component forecasts. The calculation logic and data transformation conditions can be customized as per the company\\\\u2019s requirements. DPEs can be triggered through scheduled flows.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n ###\\\\nQUESTION:\\\\nWhen Data Processing Engine generates the component forecasts for a manufacturing program, is a Forecast Set Use record automatically created?\\\\n\\\\n ###\\\\nResponse:\\\\n\\\"}, {\\\"type\\\": \\\"Policy\\\", \\\"scope\\\": \\\"Global\\\", \\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"layer\\\": \\\"Post\\\", \\\"languageScope\\\": null, \\\"content\\\": \\\"You must generate the output in ENGLISH\\\\nFollow this tone and style guideline when crafting your output: \\\\nExpress professionalism with deontic modality and declarative sentences. \\\\n Default to periods for punctuation, only ask questions when necessary. \\\\n Do not use intensifiers.

Creating a contact will automatically create the corresponding administrative account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: NMH creates relationship records between Robert and anyone who gives on his behalf. Let\\\\u2019s follow along as the Development team creates this record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Go to a contact record, click the menu arrow ( and click New Relationship.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Go to a contact record, click the menu arrow ( and click New Relationship.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 2: Related Contact Roles on an opportunity detail record\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Enter the contacts and choose the Solicitor OCR in the Related Oppor- tunity Contact Role field.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn any future gifts from that same donor, a solicitor contact role is automatically created for Robert and he will earn soft credit for the donation. (If the situation doesn\\\\u2019t apply to a particular gift, NMH can always delete Robert\\\\u2019s OCR on the opportunity.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want NPSP to stop generating automated soft credits from a particular relationship record, remove the value in the Related Opportunity Contact Role field on the relationship record. Additionally, the Status field does not affect automated soft credits\\\\u2014soft credits function regardless of a Current or Former value in the Status field.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can use a Salesforce automation tool like Flow Builder if you want to update the Related Opportunity Contact Role field based on the value of other fields, such as Status or other custom fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: Contact Role related list on the opportunity record\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 4: Note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAutomatic Soft Credits from Affiliations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNPSP can automatically create soft credits for organizational donations based on affiliation records. These are like relationship records but connect a contact and an account instead of two contacts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou would use an affiliation record, for example, if the members of a family foundation should receive soft credit for every donation made by the organization. Each would have an affiliation record with the family foundation\\\\u2019s account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_23.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: 5.

Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that the family member now appears in the Contacts related list on the Household Account record. But how do you capture the relationship that exists between these two Contacts? Let\\\\u2019s handle that next.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConnect Household Contacts to Each Other\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Return to the student\\\\u2019s Contact record. You can find your way back from anywhere in the user interface that you see the student\\\\u2019s name linked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. From the actions menu on the Relationships related list, click New. 3. Under Related Contact, select the family member\\\\u2019s name, such as the guardian whose record you just created.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. Select the type of relationship this person has to the student. We call this list of options a picklist, which is a good way to enforce consistent, standardized data entry and data reporting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the Relationships related list on the student\\\\u2019s Contact record shows this connection between the student and family member. You might even see information such as whether this person is an emergency contact or if they are FERPA approved. And, if you go to the family member\\\\u2019s Contact record, you see the reciprocal relationship that the family member has with the student. This view of the Relationship is created for you automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s turn our attention to Einstein Elementary, the K-5 school Darius attends in the Pleasant Trail School District.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCreate Account Records for Your District and Your Schools\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo represent each school and the district itself, we again use account records. But instead of using Household Account records like we did to represent a household of Contacts (people) in Darius\\\\u2019 family, we use a different type\\\\u2014Educational Institution Account records.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_31.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: The conversion form would have looked different if something other than the word _ Individual _ was in the Company Name field when the lead was originally created.

We didn\\\\u2019t see those options, because the Individual value entered in the Company Name field for the lead told\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNPSP to create a household account for the contact.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, the _ Do not create a new Opportunity _ option is selected and an opportunity is not created. We made sure that this checkbox was selected, so we only created a contact record.

We ignored the Record Owner field when converting the lead to a contact. This made you the contact record owner, too. If we entered another staff member\\\\u2019s name, that person would be the owner of the new contact record. Straightforward, yes, but the reason we bring this up is because there are some automation things that your admin can do with this field, like route the record to different people based on\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nthe dollar amount the lead pledges.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_28.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Information about your donors, volunteers, and other individual stakeholders is stored in Contact object records, standard records included in any Salesforce instance. Each contact record represents one person and tracks details about how to contact them. Contacts can be related to other records to track their donations and other interactions and details. Plus, with NPSP, special rollup fields show you how much each donor has given over their lifetime and other time periods.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 3: Note\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote You can also store information about individuals in Lead object records, which track people who are interested in your cause but aren\\\\u2019t contacts yet. For example, you can choose to use leads for people who give you their contact information to receive a newsletter. When they give, volunteer, or take some other action, you can convert their lead to a contact record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Salesforce, the Account object is mostly used to track companies or other organizations. In NPSP, we extend the Account object so that there are two types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHousehold account records track a group of contact records. They\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nrepresent one or more people who live in the same home or are in the same family. Household accounts include address management features and fields that automatically generate formal and informal greetings for direct mail appeals and other communications. A household account record is automatically created with a new contact when they aren\\\\u2019t associated with an account. This feature is special to NPSP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOrganization account records work like account records across most of Salesforce, tracking companies and other groups. You can use organization accounts to manage your relationships with foundations, corporate donors, schools, governments, or other nonprofits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_40.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Learning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDescribe the purpose of the account record. \\\\u2022 Edit the details of an account. \\\\u2022 Create a new associated contact. \\\\u2022 Review past interactions associated with the account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat Is an Account Record?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn a Salesforce org, every account has an individual listing that contains the details about the account and the associated relationships. Accounts can be associated with contacts, opportunities (deals in progress), cases, and more. You can complete numerous actions such as editing details, creating an associated contact, and reviewing past activity from the account record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEdit the Details\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. With an account record open, find the details about this record. 2. Click the pencil icon to the right of the Annual Revenue. 3. Enter any amount in the field. 4. Click Save. 5. Click the Edit button at the top of the account record. 6. Adjust any of the fields. 7. Click Save.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, there are multiple ways to edit your account record. Decisions are often made based on account data, so it\\\\u2018s important this data is as accurate as possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCreate an Associated Contact\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. With an account record open, click New Contact at the top of the account record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Enter a First Name and Last Name on the New Contact form. Note that the Account Name is already listed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Click Save. 4. In the related section, notice that the newly created contact is now listed in the related contacts of this account record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReview Past Activity\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. In the activity section, click New Task. (You may also have to click Create a task . . . .)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Select a Subject and enter a Due Date.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.

Contacts and accounts have a direct relationship, so the Contact object holds a many-to-many relationship with the Account object. Every contact identifies the primary account directly related to it. Anna and Nigel Murphy, Anna\\\\u2019s husband, both have a Contact record.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInsurance Policy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThink of the Insurance Policy (3) as the root object in the insurance data model. Everything else flows from here. The Insurance Policy object is a specific configuration of the product model and is based on policyholder characteristics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInsurance Policy records capture essential information, such as the policy number and type, name of the insured, effective dates, and applicable premium. Agents use Insurance Policy records to track the policies of their customers and lookups to carrier accounts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach policy can have only one account, but one account can have multiple contacts and policy participants. Insurance policy participants can be owners, drivers, or beneficiaries. We dive into policy participants later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnna has life, car, and homeowners insurance with Cumulus, but for this example, we focus on her car insurance policy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n|\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPolicy Coverage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nZeynep, our all-star sales agent, originally sold Anna her car insurance policy. Now he reaches out to Justus Pardo, a consultant for Cumulus, to map the details of Anna\\\\u2019s policy to the Salesforce insurance data model.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe insurance data model is versatile. You can update it to add records and details for a person\\\\u2019s major life events. The insurance data model organizes clusters of data, like Anna\\\\u2019s, so Cumulus can work cohesively and efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_2.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: This example shows how to add a contact to an account (the related record) by setting the AccountId field on the contact. Contact and Account are linked through a lookup relationship.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Inspect the contacts in your org.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA new account (SFDC Account) has been created and has the Mario Ruiz contact in the account\\\\u2019s Contacts related list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate Related Records\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFields on related records can\\\\u2019t be updated with the same call to the DML operation and require a separate DML call. For example, if inserting a new contact, you can specify the contact\\\\u2019s related account record by setting the value of the AccountId field. However, you can\\\\u2019t change the account\\\\u2019s name without updating the account itself with a separate DML call. Similarly, when updating a contact, if you also want to update the contact\\\\u2019s related account, you must make two DML calls. The following\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nexample updates a contact and its related account using two updatestatements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n// Query for the contact, which has been associated with an account. Contact queriedContact = [SELECT Account.Name\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFROM Contact WHERE FirstName = \\\\\\\\'Mario\\\\\\\\' AND LastName=\\\\\\\\'Ruiz\\\\\\\\' LIMIT 1];\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n// Update the contact\\\\\\\\'s phone number queriedContact.Phone = \\\\\\\\'(415)555-1213\\\\\\\\'; // Update the related account industry queriedContact.Account.Industry = \\\\\\\\'Technology\\\\\\\\'; // Make two separate calls // 1.

Contacts and accounts have a direct relationship, so the Contact object holds a many-to-many relationship with the Account object. Every contact identifies the primary account directly related to it. Anna and Nigel Murphy, Anna\\\\u2019s husband, both have a Contact record.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nInsurance Policy\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThink of the Insurance Policy (3) as the root object in the insurance data model. Everything else flows from here. The Insurance Policy object is a specific configuration of the product model and is based on policyholder characteristics.\\\\n\\\\nInsurance Policy records capture essential information, such as the policy number and type, name of the insured, effective dates, and applicable premium. Agents use Insurance Policy records to track the policies of their customers and lookups to carrier accounts.\\\\n\\\\nEach policy can have only one account, but one account can have multiple contacts and policy participants. Insurance policy participants can be owners, drivers, or beneficiaries. We dive into policy participants later.\\\\n\\\\nAnna has life, car, and homeowners insurance with Cumulus, but for this example, we focus on her car insurance policy.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nPolicy Coverage\\\\n\\\\nZeynep, our all-star sales agent, originally sold Anna her car insurance policy.

You can update it to add records and details for a person\\\\u2019s major life events.

When you first create it, the contact is a blank canvas. It simply represents a person that you have basic information about. Now you need to define how that person relates to your educational institution. Is the contact a student, a faculty member, an alumni, or more than one of those? Does the contact play sports or belong to specific clubs?\\\\n\\\\nAnd does the contact have connections to any other contacts at your educational institution? Is the contact the child of an alumni member? Is the contact married to another contact?

When you first create it, the contact is a blank canvas. It simply represents a person that you have basic information about. Now you need to define how that person relates to your educational institution. Is the contact a student, a faculty member, an alumni, or more than one of those? Does the contact play sports or belong to specific clubs?\\\\n\\\\nAnd does the contact have connections to any other contacts at your educational institution? Is the contact the child of an alumni member? Is the contact married to another contact? This is where relationships and affiliations come in.\\\\n\\\\nAs part of the EDA account model, EDA offers two important custom objects that work in conjunction with your contacts.\\\\n\\\\nThe relationship custom object tracks relationships between contacts (who do they know?)\\\\n\\\\nThe affiliation custom object tracks affiliations between contacts and other accounts (what are their interests?)\\\\n\\\\nFigure 5: An administrative account represents a contact, and that contact\\\\u2019s relationships and affiliations are then associated with the contact.\\\\n\\\\nWhat do we mean by \\\\u201cother\\\\u201d accounts in this instance? Well, in EDA that could be a department. It could also be a sports team. It might be a prospective employer. The architecture is flexible! The important thing to remember is that affiliated accounts aren\\\\u2019t other people. They\\\\u2019re things or groups such as depart- ments, academic programs, universities, and other companies or organizations. And as part of the affiliation, you determine the connection the contact has to the account (student,\\\\n\\\\nfaculty, athlete, and so on) by including the contact\\\\u2019s role.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_9.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Let\\\\u2019s take a moment to admire the new opportunity record. To find it, you can click the message that appears to tell you that the opportunity was created. Or, you can click the Related tab on the contact record, find the Opportunities related list, and select the new opportunity\\\\u2019s name.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The new opportunity record for Candace Evans\\\\u2019s donation\\\\n\\\\nThe opportunity record includes more fields than were included in the New Donation interface. That\\\\u2019s because the New Donation button is what we call a quick action. It includes only the basic fields required to create an opportunity\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nrecord. If you want to choose a different opportunity record type, or want the option to initially enter more data about an opportunity, your starting point is to click the New button on either a contact\\\\u2019s Opportunities related list or the Opportunities tab.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to edit or change the opportunity record, click either the Edit quick ) next to any field. action or the edit icon (\\\\n\\\\nOne more thing to note: Creating this opportunity also automatically created a payment record. You can find that in the Payments related list on the Related tab. We\\\\u2019ll cover payments in the next unit.\\\\n\\\\nEnter Donations from a Company or Other Organization\\\\n\\\\nAs Sofia works through donations from individuals who attended the house party, she comes across a check from a local business called Cloud Kicks. Remember, the Opportunity object is used to also manage donations from organizations tracked using the Account object, like private foundations, corporate donors, governments, and others.\\\\n\\\\nCreating a donation from an account is almost identical to creating a donation from an individual. Let\\\\u2019s follow along as Sofia creates a donation from Cloud Kicks.\\\\n\\\\n1. Find and select the donor\\\\u2019s account. We\\\\u2019ll find and select Cloud Kicks from Global Search in this example.\\\\n\\\\n2. Click the Related tab if it isn\\\\u2019t already open on the page.\\\\n\\\\n3. Click New on the Opportunities related list.\\\\n###\\\\nThe administrative account is the account-level representation of a contact. It\\\\u2019s a one-to-one relationship that exists mainly to fulfill the Salesforce data model requirement that every contact have an associated account. Higher education institutions might prefer to use the lightweight, individual admin- istrative account during certain parts of the student lifecycle\\\\u2014recruiting, admissions, and while actively enrolled.\\\\n\\\\nThe _household account _represents the household a student contact belongs to. Unlike the administrative account\\\\u2019s one-to-one relationship, a household account typically contains multiple contacts besides the student, such as parents or guardians, siblings, and other members of a shared household. An alumni or advancement office might prefer to convert contacts to a household account model after they\\\\u2019ve become alumni.\\\\n\\\\nThere are some strategic choices to make around your institution\\\\u2019s preferred account model and the information in the EDA Data Architecture Basics module mentioned above can help you make them. Not sure yet which account model is best for you? Good news: you can try both models now in your trial org. If you\\\\u2019re logged into your trial org you\\\\u2019re in the right place to practice creating account records! Let\\\\u2019s start with administrative accounts.\\\\n\\\\nCreate a New Contact and Administrative Account\\\\n\\\\nOnce you choose an account model and make the selection in EDA Settings (we show you how to do that below), it will be the default account record for all newly created contact records. The default account model in the EDA trial is the administrative account model so you don\\\\u2019t have to do anything special to create a new administrative account. Creating a contact will automatically create the corresponding administrative account.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: NMH creates relationship records between Robert and anyone who gives on his behalf. Let\\\\u2019s follow along as the Development team creates this record.\\\\n\\\\n1. Go to a contact record, click the menu arrow ( and click New Relationship.\\\\n\\\\n1. Go to a contact record, click the menu arrow ( and click New Relationship.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Related Contact Roles on an opportunity detail record\\\\n\\\\n2. Enter the contacts and choose the Solicitor OCR in the Related Oppor- tunity Contact Role field.\\\\n\\\\n3. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nOn any future gifts from that same donor, a solicitor contact role is automatically created for Robert and he will earn soft credit for the donation. (If the situation doesn\\\\u2019t apply to a particular gift, NMH can always delete Robert\\\\u2019s OCR on the opportunity.)\\\\n\\\\nIf you want NPSP to stop generating automated soft credits from a particular relationship record, remove the value in the Related Opportunity Contact Role field on the relationship record. Additionally, the Status field does not affect automated soft credits\\\\u2014soft credits function regardless of a Current or Former value in the Status field.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use a Salesforce automation tool like Flow Builder if you want to update the Related Opportunity Contact Role field based on the value of other fields, such as Status or other custom fields.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Contact Role related list on the opportunity record\\\\n\\\\nFigure 4: Note\\\\n\\\\nAutomatic Soft Credits from Affiliations\\\\n\\\\nNPSP can automatically create soft credits for organizational donations based on affiliation records. These are like relationship records but connect a contact and an account instead of two contacts.\\\\n\\\\nYou would use an affiliation record, for example, if the members of a family foundation should receive soft credit for every donation made by the organization. Each would have an affiliation record with the family foundation\\\\u2019s account.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_23.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: 5. Don\\\\u2019t change the Account Name field. By creating this Contact record from the Household Account record, it automatically associates the person with the correct household\\\\u2014which is exactly what you want.\\\\n\\\\n6. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nNotice that the family member now appears in the Contacts related list on the Household Account record. But how do you capture the relationship that exists between these two Contacts? Let\\\\u2019s handle that next.\\\\n\\\\nConnect Household Contacts to Each Other\\\\n\\\\n1. Return to the student\\\\u2019s Contact record. You can find your way back from anywhere in the user interface that you see the student\\\\u2019s name linked.\\\\n\\\\n2. From the actions menu on the Relationships related list, click New. 3. Under Related Contact, select the family member\\\\u2019s name, such as the guardian whose record you just created.\\\\n\\\\n4. Select the type of relationship this person has to the student. We call this list of options a picklist, which is a good way to enforce consistent, standardized data entry and data reporting.\\\\n\\\\n5. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the Relationships related list on the student\\\\u2019s Contact record shows this connection between the student and family member. You might even see information such as whether this person is an emergency contact or if they are FERPA approved. And, if you go to the family member\\\\u2019s Contact record, you see the reciprocal relationship that the family member has with the student. This view of the Relationship is created for you automatically.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s turn our attention to Einstein Elementary, the K-5 school Darius attends in the Pleasant Trail School District.\\\\n\\\\nCreate Account Records for Your District and Your Schools\\\\n\\\\nTo represent each school and the district itself, we again use account records. But instead of using Household Account records like we did to represent a household of Contacts (people) in Darius\\\\u2019 family, we use a different type\\\\u2014Educational Institution Account records.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_31.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: The conversion form would have looked different if something other than the word _ Individual _ was in the Company Name field when the lead was originally created. When there\\\\u2019s a company (or organization) name in that field, the lead to contact conversion form includes options to create either a household or an organization account, and an option to create an affiliation for the contact. We didn\\\\u2019t see those options, because the Individual value entered in the Company Name field for the lead told\\\\n\\\\nNPSP to create a household account for the contact.\\\\n\\\\nBy default, the _ Do not create a new Opportunity _ option is selected and an opportunity is not created. We made sure that this checkbox was selected, so we only created a contact record. However, if the box is not selected, a new donation opportunity related to the new contact is automatically created, using the contact name as the opportunity record name,\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nwith the Stage field set to Prospecting and an amount of zero dollars. We\\\\u2019re not going to go into opportunities in this module, but the possibilities of what you can do with this are pretty exciting. There\\\\u2019s more information on this topic included in an article linked in the Resources section below. Review that, and talk to your admin if this is something you\\\\u2019d like to explore.\\\\n\\\\nRecord ownership can be transferred manually at the time of conver- sion or be automated. We ignored the Record Owner field when converting the lead to a contact. This made you the contact record owner, too. If we entered another staff member\\\\u2019s name, that person would be the owner of the new contact record. Straightforward, yes, but the reason we bring this up is because there are some automation things that your admin can do with this field, like route the record to different people based on\\\\n\\\\nthe dollar amount the lead pledges.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_28.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Information about your donors, volunteers, and other individual stakeholders is stored in Contact object records, standard records included in any Salesforce instance. Each contact record represents one person and tracks details about how to contact them. Contacts can be related to other records to track their donations and other interactions and details. Plus, with NPSP, special rollup fields show you how much each donor has given over their lifetime and other time periods.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Note\\\\n\\\\nNote You can also store information about individuals in Lead object records, which track people who are interested in your cause but aren\\\\u2019t contacts yet. For example, you can choose to use leads for people who give you their contact information to receive a newsletter. When they give, volunteer, or take some other action, you can convert their lead to a contact record.\\\\n\\\\nIn Salesforce, the Account object is mostly used to track companies or other organizations. In NPSP, we extend the Account object so that there are two types.\\\\n\\\\nHousehold account records track a group of contact records. They\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nrepresent one or more people who live in the same home or are in the same family. Household accounts include address management features and fields that automatically generate formal and informal greetings for direct mail appeals and other communications. A household account record is automatically created with a new contact when they aren\\\\u2019t associated with an account. This feature is special to NPSP.\\\\n\\\\nOrganization account records work like account records across most of Salesforce, tracking companies and other groups. You can use organization accounts to manage your relationships with foundations, corporate donors, schools, governments, or other nonprofits.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_40.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Learning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nDescribe the purpose of the account record. \\\\u2022 Edit the details of an account. \\\\u2022 Create a new associated contact. \\\\u2022 Review past interactions associated with the account.\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is an Account Record?\\\\n\\\\nIn a Salesforce org, every account has an individual listing that contains the details about the account and the associated relationships. Accounts can be associated with contacts, opportunities (deals in progress), cases, and more. You can complete numerous actions such as editing details, creating an associated contact, and reviewing past activity from the account record.\\\\n\\\\nEdit the Details\\\\n\\\\n1. With an account record open, find the details about this record. 2. Click the pencil icon to the right of the Annual Revenue. 3. Enter any amount in the field. 4. Click Save. 5. Click the Edit button at the top of the account record. 6. Adjust any of the fields. 7. Click Save.\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see, there are multiple ways to edit your account record. Decisions are often made based on account data, so it\\\\u2018s important this data is as accurate as possible.\\\\n\\\\nCreate an Associated Contact\\\\n\\\\n1. With an account record open, click New Contact at the top of the account record.\\\\n\\\\n2. Enter a First Name and Last Name on the New Contact form. Note that the Account Name is already listed.\\\\n\\\\n3. Click Save. 4. In the related section, notice that the newly created contact is now listed in the related contacts of this account record.\\\\n\\\\nReview Past Activity\\\\n\\\\n1. In the activity section, click New Task. (You may also have to click Create a task . . . .)\\\\n\\\\n2. Select a Subject and enter a Due Date.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n3. Click Save. 4. At the bottom of the activity section is this account\\\\u2019s activity timeline. Your newly created task is now listed on this timeline. All logged communications and tasks associated with this account appear here.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Contact\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nEach person related to the account should have a single Contact record (2). Contacts and accounts have a direct relationship, so the Contact object holds a many-to-many relationship with the Account object. Every contact identifies the primary account directly related to it. Anna and Nigel Murphy, Anna\\\\u2019s husband, both have a Contact record.\\\\n\\\\n| |\\\\n\\\\nInsurance Policy\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nThink of the Insurance Policy (3) as the root object in the insurance data model. Everything else flows from here. The Insurance Policy object is a specific configuration of the product model and is based on policyholder characteristics.\\\\n\\\\nInsurance Policy records capture essential information, such as the policy number and type, name of the insured, effective dates, and applicable premium. Agents use Insurance Policy records to track the policies of their customers and lookups to carrier accounts.\\\\n\\\\nEach policy can have only one account, but one account can have multiple contacts and policy participants. Insurance policy participants can be owners, drivers, or beneficiaries. We dive into policy participants later.\\\\n\\\\nAnna has life, car, and homeowners insurance with Cumulus, but for this example, we focus on her car insurance policy.\\\\n\\\\n|\\\\n\\\\nPolicy Coverage\\\\n\\\\nZeynep, our all-star sales agent, originally sold Anna her car insurance policy. Now he reaches out to Justus Pardo, a consultant for Cumulus, to map the details of Anna\\\\u2019s policy to the Salesforce insurance data model.\\\\n\\\\nThe insurance data model is versatile. You can update it to add records and details for a person\\\\u2019s major life events. The insurance data model organizes clusters of data, like Anna\\\\u2019s, so Cumulus can work cohesively and efficiently.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_2.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: This example shows how to add a contact to an account (the related record) by setting the AccountId field on the contact. Contact and Account are linked through a lookup relationship.\\\\n\\\\n1. Execute this snippet in the Anonymous Apex window of the Developer Console.\\\\n\\\\nAccount acct = new Account(Name='SFDC Account'); insert acct; // Once the account is inserted, the sObject will be // populated with an ID. // Get this ID. ID acctID = acct.ID; // Add a contact to this account. Contact mario = new Contact(\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\nFirstName='Mario', LastName='Ruiz', Phone='415.555.1212', AccountId=acctID);\\\\n\\\\ninsert mario;\\\\n\\\\n2. Inspect the contacts in your org.\\\\n\\\\nA new account (SFDC Account) has been created and has the Mario Ruiz contact in the account\\\\u2019s Contacts related list.\\\\n\\\\nUpdate Related Records\\\\n\\\\nFields on related records can\\\\u2019t be updated with the same call to the DML operation and require a separate DML call. For example, if inserting a new contact, you can specify the contact\\\\u2019s related account record by setting the value of the AccountId field. However, you can\\\\u2019t change the account\\\\u2019s name without updating the account itself with a separate DML call. Similarly, when updating a contact, if you also want to update the contact\\\\u2019s related account, you must make two DML calls. The following\\\\n\\\\nexample updates a contact and its related account using two updatestatements.\\\\n\\\\n// Query for the contact, which has been associated with an account. Contact queriedContact = [SELECT Account.Name\\\\n\\\\nFROM Contact WHERE FirstName = 'Mario' AND LastName='Ruiz' LIMIT 1];\\\\n\\\\n// Update the contact's phone number queriedContact.Phone = '(415)555-1213'; // Update the related account industry queriedContact.Account.Industry = 'Technology'; // Make two separate calls // 1. This call is to update the contact's phone. update queriedContact; // 2.

In this module, you gain a deeper understanding of prototyping best practices you can use to support your strategy design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrototypes make ideas tangible in ways that people can interact with them. They generate low-cost answers to questions about what a team can build and how that product, service, or experience can look, feel, behave, and drive outcomes. Prototypes greatly reduce an organization\\\\u2019s risk when bringing innovative concepts to market. They become the first way a team can measure their ability to deliver on desired business and social outcomes with new ideas or concepts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s a Prototype?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA prototype is an experiment that\\\\u2019s purpose-built to answer a specific question in the design and build process.

For example, imagine someone claims that being in a specific market stall would drive sales, but you\\\\u2019re skeptical of that claim. If this person went on to pitch the best possible uses of that stall, you might think to yourself, \\\\u201cHold on, I\\\\u2019m still not sure that stall is the key to driving sales.\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis type of thing happens a lot in product strategy, design, and innovation work. There might be a disconnect between the premise around what drives business outcomes, and the product design work that creates user experiences. That\\\\u2019s because there\\\\u2019s a layer of translation between the business-speak of outcomes, and the design-speak of customer needs and user experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most important things strategy designers do is to ensure that your groups of stakeholders, decision-makers, and leaders agree on the premises on which your strategies are based. As a strategy design project moves through different phases of work, you\\\\u2019re moving the group from ambiguity to clarity of vision by building one premise on top of another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut as you saw with the market stall example, you need to make sure that the group believes in the first premise before moving on to the next one. With that in mind, here are some key moments in the design process to ensure you have alignment before moving on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: Key moments in the design process: Discover, Define, Design, Deliver, Deploy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChallenge framing defines what success looks like. This happens before the Discover phase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSource__c', 'content': 'FilePath__c'}, {'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'DataSourceObject__c', 'content': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm'}, {'objectName': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'fieldName': 'FilePath__c', 'content': 'data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_17.pdf'}]}, {'metadata': [{'source_object_record_id': 'combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf', 'source_object_api_name': 'RagFileUDMO__dlm', 'link': 'https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T065022Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=58c17a967ef0d498d4ace92fb3aff86a04f035ad5a148c7adc03f882dffbad36'}], 'id': None, 'contents': [{'objectName': 'FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm', 'fieldName': 'Chunk__c', 'content': 'Module/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Essential Business Analyst Skills \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/business- analyst_skills-strategies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: business-analyst_skills-strategies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Analyst, Filter-API-name: business-analyst \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusiness\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIntelligence, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nness_intelligence\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nbusi-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShift to Ideation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDefine ideation. \\\\u2022 Explain why ideation is important. \\\\u2022 Describe the brainstorming planning process. \\\\u2022 Write a How Might We brainstorm prompt.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhy Ideation Is Important\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve completed other badges in the Learn Strategy Design trail, you\\\\u2019ve learned about some key concepts and steps involved, from alignment as a strategic craft to framing a challenge through research and discovery.

More and more customers are expecting digital experiences across all of their brand interactions, and ecommerce continues to grow exponentially.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, brands are increasingly taking their business online to reach customers. However, connecting with customers digitally takes much more than spinning up a digital storefront. Brands must transform every part of their marketing process to ensure they\\\\u2019re meeting the needs and expectations of their all-digital customers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat does this transformation involve, exactly? Well, to engage customers, marketers are tasked with the following.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_8.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: \\\\u201cEarly experiences with doctors create attitudes and expectations that last.

These are truths about customers and their lives and contexts, and they are backed by evidence and empathy from the many research conversations the team conducted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may also notice that the insights aren\\\\u2019t revolutionary or even surprising. The point isn\\\\u2019t to be innovative at this step of the process, it\\\\u2019s to articulate those fundamental truths on which you can build meaningful products, services, and connections with customers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn isolation, individual insights don\\\\u2019t point toward opportunities for design. But in combination and with a design challenge statement giving them context, 5\\\\u201310 insights begin to form a point of view on the kinds of strategies an organization should pursue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you\\\\u2019ve written your insights as statements, evaluate them again, and as a group. Do you see opportunities beginning to emerge? Keep refining your insights until you do.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDefine Opportunity Areas\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you share key insights, you are creating some compassion for customers and shared understanding of the challenge. Your stakeholders will then want to know what you can do with those insights. So define opportunity areas before sharing your insights.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Jobs to Be Done Framework for Designers \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/jobs-to-be- done-framework-for-designers\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: jobs-to-be-done-framework-for-designers \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 40 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Research and Discovery, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsearch_and_discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nre-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCraft Key Insights\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExplain how to synthesize data into insights. \\\\u2022 Explain how to narrow down to key insights. \\\\u2022 Define what opportunity areas are. \\\\u2022 Explain the value of a job statement in communicating customer needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat Is an Insight?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo you\\\\u2019ve planned your research and conducted your first session. Congratula- tions! Odds are you learned a lot, and you may have walked away with some quotes that do a great job of communicating important information. In order to make this information useful for your work, your team, and your stakeholders, you have to synthesize the raw information you collected into insights.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInsights are foundational discoveries and understandings of the truth. Born of a combination of evidence and empathy, insights explain the how and why behind observable behaviors, phenomena, or constructs. And they catalyze people to think about how to nurture or improve upon what\\\\u2019s true today. Insights form the basis for strategy design unlocking opportunities for innovation and leading to ideas that are meaningful to people, creating real value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCrafting insights is part art and part science.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nI need an easy way to find out when they\\\\u2019ll arrive and what\\\\u2019s taking so long\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo I can stay positive and plan my moment to show them off to my friends and family\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt first blush it may look a bit like an Agile user story, but they\\\\u2019re very different. User stories explain a feature or task to be built, after a solution has been designed. Job stories are like mini-briefs, which describe a larger goal and the functional, social, and emotional needs behind it. They do not contain a solution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCreate one to three job stories for each opportunity area you\\\\u2019ve identified. If you need a refresher on how to create job stories, check out our Jobs to Be Done for Designers module.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou just learned how to do a ton of great user centered design work. But as we know, an important part of assuring your project\\\\u2019s success is bringing your stakeholders along for the journey. In the next unit we discuss how to communicate about the activities you\\\\u2019ve done in your initial design research phase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_External: _The Best Breakthroughs Come from Moments of Doubt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Craft Key Insights \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: craft-key-insights \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 15 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/research- for-design-strategy/craft-key-insights\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Research for Strategy Design \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/research- for-design-strategy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: research-for-design-strategy \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 500 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 45 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Strategy, Filter-API-name: business_strategy \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Research and Discovery, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsearch_and_discovery\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nre-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCraft Your Content and Promotion Strategy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Module/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Essential Business Analyst Skills \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/business- analyst_skills-strategies\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPI-name: business-analyst_skills-strategies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Analyst, Filter-API-name: business-analyst \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusiness\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIntelligence, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nness_intelligence\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nbusi-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShift to Ideation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDefine ideation. \\\\u2022 Explain why ideation is important. \\\\u2022 Describe the brainstorming planning process. \\\\u2022 Write a How Might We brainstorm prompt.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhy Ideation Is Important\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve completed other badges in the Learn Strategy Design trail, you\\\\u2019ve learned about some key concepts and steps involved, from alignment as a strategic craft to framing a challenge through research and discovery. In this module, you explore ideation methods and best practices you can use during the design process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re feeling a time crunch and wondering whether you have time to spend on ideation\\\\u2014 the process of generating solution ideas\\\\u2014think of it this way: Building the wrong solution is more expensive, and takes more time than ideation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe chances that any of us can come up with the right solution the first time we think about a challenge are pretty slim. The ideation and concepting phase of the design process is a rigorous practice of creating a selection of ideas to consider. A byproduct of this practice is that you discover the tradeoffs (common trade-offs are effort vs. value, time vs. cost, compromise vs. sacrifice) implicit in your options.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_22.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: Module/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Innovation Ideation & Prototyping \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_ideation_prototyping \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_ideation_prototyping \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 300 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 50 \\\\u2022 Filters: \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct Management, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nprod-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nuct_management\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrame the Challenge\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSummarize your organization\\\\u2019s background and current situation. \\\\u2022 Define the concept of an orthodoxy. \\\\u2022 Facilitate an orthodoxy-busting exercise with a group of people.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAre You and Your Company Ready to Begin?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that you\\\\u2019ve recruited your innovation team and you\\\\u2019ve outlined some high- level problems, it\\\\u2019s time to get more rigorous. In the modules that follow, we introduce methods to give you some direction for your own innovation project. It starts with an honest look in the mirror and an assessment of where your company is today.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSize Up Your Organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore any innovation journey, it\\\\u2019s good practice to assess your organization\\\\u2019s background and current situation. It helps you answer the important questions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is the high-level business problem that you\\\\u2019re solving? Instead of boiling the ocean, zero in on an area of opportunity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWho is the customer impacted by the business problem? Are you targeting your employees, customers, or partners? And within that audience, which specific segments?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s use a fictitious company to test these questions.\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nHere are three recommendations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Set intentions \\\\u2014Let your manager know your intention to take on an innovation project. Gain your manager\\\\u2019s endorsement and mentorship. Experimenting in secret can be fun, but most managers don\\\\u2019t like surprises. 2. Set learning goals \\\\u2014Together with your manager, set learning goals. What could the organization learn, and what could you personally stand to learn?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Secure manager commitment \\\\u2014Based on your learning goals, secure your manager\\\\u2019s commitment that you will be rewarded if you succeed and, no matter what the result, be rewarded for trying.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy having an open dialogue with your team and boss, we hope that you embark on this journey with support, encouragement, and appreciation. The confidence to persevere is built with trust, transparency, and grit\\\\u2014the ability to adapt or pivot better, faster, smarter\\\\u2014together.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlright, let\\\\u2019s dive in!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe 5 Requirements of a Truly Innovative Company \\\\u2022 How to Use Divergent and Convergent Thinking to Improve Your Work\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Build and Lead Your Team \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_basics_build_lead \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 20 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_basics/innovation_basics_build_lead\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Innovation Basics \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_basics \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_basics \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 300 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 40 \\\\u2022 Filters: \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Strategy, Filter-API-name: business_strategy \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n###\\\\\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTitle: Innovation Solution \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_solution \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_solution \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 300 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 50 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBusiness Solutions, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nness_solutions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsystem_design_and_implementation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nbusi-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDrive Momentum to Grow Your Vision\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nList marketing tactics for helping your vision go viral. \\\\u2022 Articulate one key piece of advice about inspiring a movement to grow your vision.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDescribe two styles of innovation movement leaders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou Got the Green Light!

(We haven\\\\u2019t written that trail yet!)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut just so we don\\\\u2019t leave you hanging, we\\\\u2019ll share a few suggestions on important activities during your first 60\\\\u201390 days after getting approval for your project. It all comes down to inspiring a movement inside your organization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSeeing Is Believing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUp until now, it\\\\u2019s likely that only a small community of people outside the members of your innovation team are aware of your project and its goals. Just as you phased the development of the product, we recommend that you phase your project announcements. Focus on those individuals who\\\\u2019ll be involved with building and developing it. Add to this group the people who will become instant evangelists because they share your vision.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_17.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Personal Success, Filter-API-name: personal_success\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGain Alignment\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentify the key moments in the design process when alignment matters most.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDescribe ways to assess your starting point. \\\\u2022 Create the conditions for alignment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKey Moments to Ensure Alignment\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve ever heard someone make a case based on a premise you didn\\\\u2019t agree with, you\\\\u2019ve seen the importance of gaining alignment before moving on. For example, imagine someone claims that being in a specific market stall would drive sales, but you\\\\u2019re skeptical of that claim. If this person went on to pitch the best possible uses of that stall, you might think to yourself, \\\\u201cHold on, I\\\\u2019m still not sure that stall is the key to driving sales.\\\\u201d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis type of thing happens a lot in product strategy, design, and innovation work. There might be a disconnect between the premise around what drives business outcomes, and the product design work that creates user experiences. That\\\\u2019s because there\\\\u2019s a layer of translation between the business-speak of outcomes, and the design-speak of customer needs and user experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne of the most important things strategy designers do is to ensure that your groups of stakeholders, decision-makers, and leaders agree on the premises on which your strategies are based. As a strategy design project moves through different phases of work, you\\\\u2019re moving the group from ambiguity to clarity of vision by building one premise on top of another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut as you saw with the market stall example, you need to make sure that the group believes in the first premise before moving on to the next one. With that in mind, here are some key moments in the design process to ensure you have alignment before moving on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFigure 1: Key moments in the design process: Discover, Define, Design, Deliver, Deploy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChallenge framing defines what success looks like. This happens before the Discover phase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf\\\\\\\\nFilePath__c: name: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Customer Service, Filter-API-name: customer_service \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProduct Development, Filter-API-name:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nuct_development\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: User Interface and User Experience Design, Filter-API-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nname: user_interface_and_user_experience_design\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nprod-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExplore Key Prototyping Considerations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDefine a prototype. \\\\u2022 Explain how prototyping helps with strategy design. \\\\u2022 Ask the right questions as you create your prototyping strategy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake Ideas Tangible\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve completed other badges in the Learn Strategy Design trail, you\\\\u2019ve learned about some key concepts and steps, from framing a challenge to the importance of research to best practices for idea generation. In this module, you gain a deeper understanding of prototyping best practices you can use to support your strategy design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrototypes make ideas tangible in ways that people can interact with them. They generate low-cost answers to questions about what a team can build and how that product, service, or experience can look, feel, behave, and drive outcomes. Prototypes greatly reduce an organization\\\\u2019s risk when bringing innovative concepts to market. They become the first way a team can measure their ability to deliver on desired business and social outcomes with new ideas or concepts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s a Prototype?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA prototype is an experiment that\\\\u2019s purpose-built to answer a specific question in the design and build process. Prototypes can be used to answer questions at any level. They range from high-level and strategic (\\\\u201cIs our brand seen as credible when talking to customers about community?\\\\u201d) to tactical and experiential (\\\\u201cDoes this mobile app work the way users expect it to?\\\\u201d). Prototypes can be made to answer questions related to physical and digital products, services, experiences, processes, and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n ###\\\\\\\\nQUESTION:\\\\\\\\nKey insights must specifically refer to a product, project challenge, or brand.

For example, imagine someone claims that being in a specific market stall would drive sales, but you\\\\u2019re skeptical of that claim. If this person went on to pitch the best possible uses of that stall, you might think to yourself, \\\\u201cHold on, I\\\\u2019m still not sure that stall is the key to driving sales.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis type of thing happens a lot in product strategy, design, and innovation work. There might be a disconnect between the premise around what drives business outcomes, and the product design work that creates user experiences. That\\\\u2019s because there\\\\u2019s a layer of translation between the business-speak of outcomes, and the design-speak of customer needs and user experience.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most important things strategy designers do is to ensure that your groups of stakeholders, decision-makers, and leaders agree on the premises on which your strategies are based. As a strategy design project moves through different phases of work, you\\\\u2019re moving the group from ambiguity to clarity of vision by building one premise on top of another.\\\\n\\\\nBut as you saw with the market stall example, you need to make sure that the group believes in the first premise before moving on to the next one. With that in mind, here are some key moments in the design process to ensure you have alignment before moving on.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: Key moments in the design process: Discover, Define, Design, Deliver, Deploy.\\\\n\\\\nChallenge framing defines what success looks like. This happens before the Discover phase.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_17.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T065022Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=58c17a967ef0d498d4ace92fb3aff86a04f035ad5a148c7adc03f882dffbad36\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Module/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Essential Business Analyst Skills \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/business- analyst_skills-strategies\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: business-analyst_skills-strategies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Analyst, Filter-API-name: business-analyst \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\n\\\\nBusiness\\\\n\\\\nIntelligence, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nness_intelligence\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\nbusi-\\\\n\\\\nShift to Ideation\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nDefine ideation. \\\\u2022 Explain why ideation is important. \\\\u2022 Describe the brainstorming planning process. \\\\u2022 Write a How Might We brainstorm prompt.\\\\n\\\\nWhy Ideation Is Important\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve completed other badges in the Learn Strategy Design trail, you\\\\u2019ve learned about some key concepts and steps involved, from alignment as a strategic craft to framing a challenge through research and discovery.

The ideation and concepting phase of the design process is a rigorous practice of creating a selection of ideas to consider. A byproduct of this practice is that you discover the tradeoffs (common trade-offs are effort vs. value, time vs. cost, compromise vs. sacrifice) implicit in your options.\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSource__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"DataSourceObject__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\"}, {\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"FilePath__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\"}]}, {\\\"metadata\\\": [{\\\"source_object_record_id\\\": \\\"combined_pdfs_part_9.pdf\\\", \\\"source_object_api_name\\\": \\\"RagFileUDMO__dlm\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://test1-uswest2-cdp002-lakehouse-1.s3.amazonaws.com/sfdrive/a360-testcdp002-32c3c8e7d9e344cb9d6ba6fdcef9cde3/cplt-copilot_dw/data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_9.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIb%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDIrI6Mmc5beXFhMtCNxvPy9PjOAzArJ4Y6fhKflyItDQIhAPA4IsNqgAbSnSSBNV11oAgz5wQjkFDtjBRtKa3iPemYKrAECP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQABoMNjM3NDIzNTk2NzQ0IgzVCdH%2Fvrs%2Be%2Bsvoe4qhATRERITcOgbxJ7mpjHKEq69cVv5UQyqEMI1zJzZLmW8M2Afmv8lpcCczOkthmRiERxuPxnPRGCAND9NPh0ildP8guAehDG7qkvdJ1d%2Fk7wPZI%2F6VIxotxqc%2FzBkNPqVtqctaV23uDUq92NZf%2FgjzZF%2FmXPzy1vG9NNLURJIsXWC6K8cKxcQJVcsLc4cJCmsiix3ZwiYYUrSmIWJ3%2BUxIiI9lcqYR5MtjIGAkPKf5gCKRU7ZY%2FPXybKa8uhCNAcGebjWHwE9GTDLy4LsZjNOKjKTFIKnW2zXw01kj7GMCi1ZqYU7Ckb7DbVN7uDEYl1XzFh1J8ndShPzBrgh5iQKzYG4E%2FrISRBticbEoO3Xwp%2BX%2BnbdRazn4f7v%2B3zwdfBOhPkMqYt7hOYRc%2F38rlxIjONlK5LnKNUmLO7HAESWeYIJmIzB0tP1%2FYhA3a1u39V%2FjAIPHwW2O%2BqcvDr0GlJhWva5U4gvwRbwqhvVkTz0%2FZ03uTJMJ7MSVwuC7792HcU9DOPci3KYEnHE86iSOn%2B6sStuUkfyicDBUMnZSRUXQabguYjYR%2B5l6AkBVDO3QcJpNcnsi1YcKnvnnC2RChsaLPRhJfinfje6Y7JWfj4C7X2rjZloLqXKygUC%2Bcf%2FH7fCmzgUXM5K3v37IlFK82xCbAmVQY8tBXUhUJ8FWn%2FutmHdAocWntwwkL7yvwY6nAH601vBtkSQhr8YLTlQAPx8kUt5IVFIhv3ukfc%2Bz4x8Z1IJ8zLM5gSpzjvfIalYD03AwYiCLURDZLdr05kTXpXF6i%2BjfZgR1g5qd9dgvt62jmxn25PEYePA3n2QFtErAmJXb4ZRm0W9Y4Ri%2F3BqmecZzC3MQo%2F%2FR64T2z6LtyIdwvi7EECOo8p4mo2UT%2FNY2DHs7XG9j5ipIBhswe8%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20250414T065022Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=1200&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAZI2LIGTEIYGO2IOE%2F20250414%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=c0657d14f71155000f8431a9c259d06823bf1b3393b757e29c54e05163825609\\\"}], \\\"id\\\": null, \\\"contents\\\": [{\\\"objectName\\\": \\\"FileUDMO_SI_chunk__dlm\\\", \\\"fieldName\\\": \\\"Chunk__c\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Module/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Challenge Framing and Scoping \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/challenge- framing-and-scoping\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: challenge-framing-and-scoping \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 40 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Strategy, Filter-API-name: business_strategy \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Project Management, Filter-API-name: project_management\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nCreate Effective Marketing Campaigns\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nSummarize how marketers can meet the needs of all-digital customers. \\\\u2022 List ways marketers can optimize their campaigns.\\\\n\\\\nEngage the All-Digital Customer\\\\n\\\\nCustomers\\\\u2019 needs and behaviors are changing fast every day.

User stories explain a feature or task to be built, after a solution has been designed. Job stories are like mini-briefs, which describe a larger goal and the functional, social, and emotional needs behind it. They do not contain a solution.\\\\n\\\\nCreate one to three job stories for each opportunity area you\\\\u2019ve identified. If you need a refresher on how to create job stories, check out our Jobs to Be Done for Designers module.\\\\n\\\\nYou just learned how to do a ton of great user centered design work.

Well, to engage customers, marketers are tasked with the following.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_8.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: \\\\u201cEarly experiences with doctors create attitudes and expectations that last.

These are truths about customers and their lives and contexts, and they are backed by evidence and empathy from the many research conversations the team conducted.\\\\n\\\\nYou may also notice that the insights aren\\\\u2019t revolutionary or even surprising. The point isn\\\\u2019t to be innovative at this step of the process, it\\\\u2019s to articulate those fundamental truths on which you can build meaningful products, services, and connections with customers.\\\\n\\\\nIn isolation, individual insights don\\\\u2019t point toward opportunities for design. But in combination and with a design challenge statement giving them context, 5\\\\u201310 insights begin to form a point of view on the kinds of strategies an organization should pursue.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\\\u2019ve written your insights as statements, evaluate them again, and as a group. Do you see opportunities beginning to emerge? Keep refining your insights until you do.\\\\n\\\\nDefine Opportunity Areas\\\\n\\\\nWhen you share key insights, you are creating some compassion for customers and shared understanding of the challenge. Your stakeholders will then want to know what you can do with those insights. So define opportunity areas before sharing your insights.\\\\n###\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Jobs to Be Done Framework for Designers \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/jobs-to-be- done-framework-for-designers\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: jobs-to-be-done-framework-for-designers \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 40 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Research and Discovery, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nsearch_and_discovery\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\nre-\\\\n\\\\nCraft Key Insights\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nExplain how to synthesize data into insights. \\\\u2022 Explain how to narrow down to key insights. \\\\u2022 Define what opportunity areas are. \\\\u2022 Explain the value of a job statement in communicating customer needs.\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is an Insight?\\\\n\\\\nSo you\\\\u2019ve planned your research and conducted your first session. Congratula- tions! Odds are you learned a lot, and you may have walked away with some quotes that do a great job of communicating important information. In order to make this information useful for your work, your team, and your stakeholders, you have to synthesize the raw information you collected into insights.\\\\n\\\\nInsights are foundational discoveries and understandings of the truth. Born of a combination of evidence and empathy, insights explain the how and why behind observable behaviors, phenomena, or constructs. And they catalyze people to think about how to nurture or improve upon what\\\\u2019s true today. Insights form the basis for strategy design unlocking opportunities for innovation and leading to ideas that are meaningful to people, creating real value.\\\\n\\\\nCrafting insights is part art and part science.\\\\n###\\\\nI need an easy way to find out when they\\\\u2019ll arrive and what\\\\u2019s taking so long\\\\n\\\\nSo I can stay positive and plan my moment to show them off to my friends and family\\\\n\\\\nAt first blush it may look a bit like an Agile user story, but they\\\\u2019re very different. User stories explain a feature or task to be built, after a solution has been designed. Job stories are like mini-briefs, which describe a larger goal and the functional, social, and emotional needs behind it. They do not contain a solution.\\\\n\\\\nCreate one to three job stories for each opportunity area you\\\\u2019ve identified. If you need a refresher on how to create job stories, check out our Jobs to Be Done for Designers module.\\\\n\\\\nYou just learned how to do a ton of great user centered design work. But as we know, an important part of assuring your project\\\\u2019s success is bringing your stakeholders along for the journey. In the next unit we discuss how to communicate about the activities you\\\\u2019ve done in your initial design research phase.\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\n_External: _The Best Breakthroughs Come from Moments of Doubt\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Craft Key Insights \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: craft-key-insights \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 15 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/research- for-design-strategy/craft-key-insights\\\\n\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Research for Strategy Design \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/research- for-design-strategy\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: research-for-design-strategy \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 500 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 45 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Intermediate, Filter-API-name: intermediate \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Strategy, Filter-API-name: business_strategy \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Research and Discovery, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nsearch_and_discovery\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\nre-\\\\n\\\\nCraft Your Content and Promotion Strategy\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_34.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Module/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Essential Business Analyst Skills \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/business- analyst_skills-strategies\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\nAPI-name: business-analyst_skills-strategies \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 400 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 35 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Analyst, Filter-API-name: business-analyst \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\n\\\\nBusiness\\\\n\\\\nIntelligence, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nness_intelligence\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\nbusi-\\\\n\\\\nShift to Ideation\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nDefine ideation. \\\\u2022 Explain why ideation is important. \\\\u2022 Describe the brainstorming planning process. \\\\u2022 Write a How Might We brainstorm prompt.\\\\n\\\\nWhy Ideation Is Important\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve completed other badges in the Learn Strategy Design trail, you\\\\u2019ve learned about some key concepts and steps involved, from alignment as a strategic craft to framing a challenge through research and discovery.

The ideation and concepting phase of the design process is a rigorous practice of creating a selection of ideas to consider. A byproduct of this practice is that you discover the tradeoffs (common trade-offs are effort vs. value, time vs. cost, compromise vs. sacrifice) implicit in your options.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_22.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: Module/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Innovation Ideation & Prototyping \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_ideation_prototyping \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_ideation_prototyping \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 300 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 50 \\\\u2022 Filters: \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\n\\\\nProduct Management, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nprod-\\\\n\\\\nuct_management\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nFrame the Challenge\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nSummarize your organization\\\\u2019s background and current situation. \\\\u2022 Define the concept of an orthodoxy. \\\\u2022 Facilitate an orthodoxy-busting exercise with a group of people.\\\\n\\\\nAre You and Your Company Ready to Begin?\\\\n\\\\nNow that you\\\\u2019ve recruited your innovation team and you\\\\u2019ve outlined some high- level problems, it\\\\u2019s time to get more rigorous. In the modules that follow, we introduce methods to give you some direction for your own innovation project. It starts with an honest look in the mirror and an assessment of where your company is today.\\\\n\\\\nSize Up Your Organization\\\\n\\\\nBefore any innovation journey, it\\\\u2019s good practice to assess your organization\\\\u2019s background and current situation. It helps you answer the important questions.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the high-level business problem that you\\\\u2019re solving? Instead of boiling the ocean, zero in on an area of opportunity.\\\\n\\\\nWho is the customer impacted by the business problem? Are you targeting your employees, customers, or partners? And within that audience, which specific segments?\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s use a fictitious company to test these questions.\\\\n###\\\\nHere are three recommendations.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n1. Set intentions \\\\u2014Let your manager know your intention to take on an innovation project. Gain your manager\\\\u2019s endorsement and mentorship. Experimenting in secret can be fun, but most managers don\\\\u2019t like surprises. 2. Set learning goals \\\\u2014Together with your manager, set learning goals. What could the organization learn, and what could you personally stand to learn?\\\\n\\\\n3. Secure manager commitment \\\\u2014Based on your learning goals, secure your manager\\\\u2019s commitment that you will be rewarded if you succeed and, no matter what the result, be rewarded for trying.\\\\n\\\\nBy having an open dialogue with your team and boss, we hope that you embark on this journey with support, encouragement, and appreciation. The confidence to persevere is built with trust, transparency, and grit\\\\u2014the ability to adapt or pivot better, faster, smarter\\\\u2014together.\\\\n\\\\nAlright, let\\\\u2019s dive in!\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\nThe 5 Requirements of a Truly Innovative Company \\\\u2022 How to Use Divergent and Convergent Thinking to Improve Your Work\\\\n\\\\nProperties for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Build and Lead Your Team \\\\u2022 Content Part Type: units \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_basics_build_lead \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 100 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 20 \\\\u2022 Assessment-Type: MCQ \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_basics/innovation_basics_build_lead\\\\n\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Innovation Basics \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_basics \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_basics \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 300 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 40 \\\\u2022 Filters: \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Business Strategy, Filter-API-name: business_strategy \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\n###\\\\nModule/Project for this content part\\\\n\\\\nTitle: Innovation Solution \\\\u2022 Content Type: module_contents \\\\u2022 URL: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/innovation_solution \\\\u2022 API-name: innovation_solution \\\\u2022 Point-Total: 300 \\\\u2022 Minute-Total: 50 \\\\u2022 Filters:\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Beginner, Filter-API-name: beginner \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\n\\\\nBusiness Solutions, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nness_solutions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: System Design and Implementation, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nsystem_design_and_implementation\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nbusi-\\\\n\\\\nDrive Momentum to Grow Your Vision\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nList marketing tactics for helping your vision go viral. \\\\u2022 Articulate one key piece of advice about inspiring a movement to grow your vision.\\\\n\\\\nDescribe two styles of innovation movement leaders.\\\\n\\\\nYou Got the Green Light! Now What?\\\\n\\\\nWow\\\\u2014you did it! Your initiative and vision is becoming a reality. What a phenomenal achievement. As any entrepreneur would tell you, coming up with an idea and even securing funding means that you\\\\u2019ve only just begun. Now begins the exciting journey of execution. (We haven\\\\u2019t written that trail yet!)\\\\n\\\\nBut just so we don\\\\u2019t leave you hanging, we\\\\u2019ll share a few suggestions on important activities during your first 60\\\\u201390 days after getting approval for your project. It all comes down to inspiring a movement inside your organization.\\\\n\\\\nSeeing Is Believing\\\\n\\\\nUp until now, it\\\\u2019s likely that only a small community of people outside the members of your innovation team are aware of your project and its goals. Just as you phased the development of the product, we recommend that you phase your project announcements. Focus on those individuals who\\\\u2019ll be involved with building and developing it. Add to this group the people who will become instant evangelists because they share your vision.\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_17.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Personal Success, Filter-API-name: personal_success\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\nGain Alignment\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nIdentify the key moments in the design process when alignment matters most.\\\\n\\\\nDescribe ways to assess your starting point. \\\\u2022 Create the conditions for alignment.\\\\n\\\\nKey Moments to Ensure Alignment\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve ever heard someone make a case based on a premise you didn\\\\u2019t agree with, you\\\\u2019ve seen the importance of gaining alignment before moving on. For example, imagine someone claims that being in a specific market stall would drive sales, but you\\\\u2019re skeptical of that claim. If this person went on to pitch the best possible uses of that stall, you might think to yourself, \\\\u201cHold on, I\\\\u2019m still not sure that stall is the key to driving sales.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThis type of thing happens a lot in product strategy, design, and innovation work. There might be a disconnect between the premise around what drives business outcomes, and the product design work that creates user experiences. That\\\\u2019s because there\\\\u2019s a layer of translation between the business-speak of outcomes, and the design-speak of customer needs and user experience.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most important things strategy designers do is to ensure that your groups of stakeholders, decision-makers, and leaders agree on the premises on which your strategies are based. As a strategy design project moves through different phases of work, you\\\\u2019re moving the group from ambiguity to clarity of vision by building one premise on top of another.\\\\n\\\\nBut as you saw with the market stall example, you need to make sure that the group believes in the first premise before moving on to the next one. With that in mind, here are some key moments in the design process to ensure you have alignment before moving on.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: Key moments in the design process: Discover, Define, Design, Deliver, Deploy.\\\\n\\\\nChallenge framing defines what success looks like. This happens before the Discover phase.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nsource_id: data_library/1JDSB000004WVft4AG/combined_pdfs_part_15.pdf\\\\nFilePath__c: name: critical_thinking_and_problem_solving\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Customer Service, Filter-API-name: customer_service \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: Designer, Filter-API-name: designer \\\\u2013 Filter-Name: General, Filter-API-name: general \\\\u2013 Filter-Name:\\\\n\\\\nProduct Development, Filter-API-name:\\\\n\\\\nuct_development\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Filter-Name: User Interface and User Experience Design, Filter-API-\\\\n\\\\nname: user_interface_and_user_experience_design\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nprod-\\\\n\\\\nExplore Key Prototyping Considerations\\\\n\\\\nLearning Objectives\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing this unit, you\\\\u2019ll be able to:\\\\n\\\\nDefine a prototype. \\\\u2022 Explain how prototyping helps with strategy design. \\\\u2022 Ask the right questions as you create your prototyping strategy.\\\\n\\\\nMake Ideas Tangible\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve completed other badges in the Learn Strategy Design trail, you\\\\u2019ve learned about some key concepts and steps, from framing a challenge to the importance of research to best practices for idea generation. In this module, you gain a deeper understanding of prototyping best practices you can use to support your strategy design.\\\\n\\\\nPrototypes make ideas tangible in ways that people can interact with them. They generate low-cost answers to questions about what a team can build and how that product, service, or experience can look, feel, behave, and drive outcomes. Prototypes greatly reduce an organization\\\\u2019s risk when bringing innovative concepts to market. They become the first way a team can measure their ability to deliver on desired business and social outcomes with new ideas or concepts.\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s a Prototype?\\\\n\\\\nA prototype is an experiment that\\\\u2019s purpose-built to answer a specific question in the design and build process. Prototypes can be used to answer questions at any level. They range from high-level and strategic (\\\\u201cIs our brand seen as credible when talking to customers about community?\\\\u201d) to tactical and experiential (\\\\u201cDoes this mobile app work the way users expect it to?\\\\u201d).
